Im just out the front accepting it on behalf of the people and the hundreds of thousands who have served in this organisation over those odd years and for all of those who will serve into the future.
Commissioner Scipione said he was proud of the work his force undertook with German police to crack a major gun importation racket.
The investigation found parts of Glock pistols were being imported into the country through an Australia Post franchise.
They were reconstituted and found their way onto the streets it was a major prosecution he said.

The Queens birthday means so much more in more ways than it possibly means to other Australians because they see her as the law woman she said.
I work in the arts because I really believe its a platform for change and most importantly it keeps our languages our stories our rituals the passages of life alive she said.
Ms Roberts said she had seen extraordinary changes in the decades she had been working in the arts.

Theres always been music of course and we moved more towards the performing arts in the s.
We are unique as a nation. We have Australias oldest living race but we are going to have to get creative and its quite frightening when you think of how many companies have had to close and how much employment that is Ms Roberts said.

The UK honours system is overseen by the Cabinet Office Honours and Appointments Secretariat.
The Foreign Office has responsibility for the Diplomatic Service and Overseas List which recognises service overseas or service in the UK with a substantial international component.
UK nationals or citizens from the Commonwealth realms such as Australia Canada and Jamaica can be nominated for an honour.
Honorary awards for foreign nationals are recommended by the foreign secretary. 
The honours list consists of knights and dames appointments to the Order of the British Empire and gallantry awards to servicemen and women and civilians.
Nominations submitted either by government departments or by members of the public are divided into subject areas and assessed by committees comprising independent experts and senior civil servants.
Their assessments are passed to a selection committee that produces the list independently of government that is submitted to the Queen through the prime minister.
The Queen informally approves the list and letters are sent to each nominee. Once a nominee accepts the proposed honour the list is formally approved.
The honours are published in the official Crown newspaper the London Gazette twice a year at New Year and in midJune on the date of the Queens official birthday.
The Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood at St Jamess Palace then arranges investitures for the recipients to be presented with their medals by the Queen or other members of the Royal Family.
Private nominations made by individuals or by representatives of organisations to the Cabinet Office traditionally make up about a quarter of all recommendations.
The honours list does not cover peerages. Starting in May peers nominated by political parties have been vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. The commission is also involved in making recommendations for nonparty affiliated peerages.
Political donations made by a number of recipients have become the subject of media scrutiny in recent years. 
In a November response to a parliamentary committees inquiry into the honours system the Cabinet Office noted that all candidates for senior awards are checked against the lists of donations maintained and made public by the Electoral Commission.
The Main Honours Committee must satisfy itself that a party political donation has not influenced the decision to award an honour in any way the committee must be confident that the candidate would have been a meritorious recipient of an honour if he or she had not made a political donation.
A Parliamentary and Political Services Committee comprising a majority of independent members and the chief whips of the three major parties was set up in to considers honours for politicians.
But in the same year the Commons Public Administration committee urged the government to review the way the whole honours system is administered. It called on ministers to set up independent bodies to nominate recipients for awards and decide when they should be withdrawn suggesting the governments lack of willingness to clarify and open up the process was damaging public confidence. 
Honours have sometimes been forfeited. The Honours Forfeiture Committee considers cases where a recipients actions raise the question of whether they should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour.
The Queens art adviser Anthony Blunt stripped of his knighthood in after being revealed as a Soviet spy and jockey Lester Piggott who lost his OBE after he was jailed in for tax fraud are among those to have had honours annulled. 
In former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin heavily criticised over his role in the banks nearcollapse in had his knighthood removed while entertainer Rolf Harris was stripped of a CBE in March following his conviction for indecent assault.
Meanwhile a list of people who had turned down honours between and and who had since died was made public by the Cabinet Office following a BBC Freedom of Information request. The list included the authors Roald Dahl J G Ballard and Aldous Huxley and the painters Francis Bacon Lucien Freud and LS Lowry. 
Although Knights Bachelor do not comprise an order of chivalry knighthood is a dignity which has its origins in Britain in Saxon times. They are styled Sir except for clergymen who do not receive the accolade and their wives Lady.
The honour is given for for a preeminent contribution in any field of activity.
The rank of Knight Commander KBE or Dame Commander DBE Order of the British Empire commonly appears on the Diplomatic Service and Overseas list. It can be given to Britons based abroad or in an honorary capacity to foreign nationals.
The Order takes its name from the symbolic bathing which in former times was often part of the preparation of a candidate for knighthood.
This Order was founded by King George III in and is awarded to British subjects who have rendered extraordinary and important services abroad or in the Commonwealth. Ranks in the Order are Knight or Dame Grand Cross GCMG Knight or Dame Commander KCMG or DCMG and Companion CMG.
This is awarded for service of conspicuous national importance and is limited to people. Recipients wear the initials CH after their name.
King George V created these honours during World War I to reward services to the war effort by civilians at home and servicemen in support positions.
They are now awarded for prominent national or regional roles and to those making distinguished or notable contributions in their own specific areas of activity. The honour of an MBE in particular can be given for achievement or service in the community.
The medal was founded in and was awarded for meritorious actions by civilians or military personnel although the recipients did not attend a royal investiture.
It was scrapped in by former Conservative Prime Minister John Major as part of his drive towards a classless society. 
Nearly two decades on Prime Minister David Cameron has announced its revival and from to coincide with the Queens Diamond Jubilee about will be awarded annually to community volunteers. 
By prime ministers and governments had increased their influence over the distribution of awards and had gained almost total control of the system. Therefore Queen Victoria instituted The Royal Victorian Order as a personal award for services performed on her behalf.
Today this honour is still awarded in recognition of services to the royal family. The ranks are Knight or Dame Grand Cross GCVO Knight or Dame Commander KCVO or DCVO Commander CVO Lieutenant LVO and Member MVO.
More than one grade may be held by the same person and the medal may be worn along with the insignia of the Order itself.
It is said that the suggestion for the founding of this decoration was made to Queen Victoria by Florence Nightingale.
This honour is given to firefighters who have displayed conspicuous devotion to duty.

Yesterday was the Annual Awards day in the Dorchester in London and here is Worldsnooker report on the evening.
John Higgins was named snookers Player of the Year at the sports annual awards ceremony in London tonight.
Higgins won two ranking titles during the season the Australian Goldfields Open and International Championship and climbed from th to th in the world rankings.
Mark Selby was named Snooker Journalists Player of the Year after winning the World Championship and finishing the season top of the world rankings. Selbys Crucible triumph also earned him the Performance of the Year award.
The Kunlunshan Fans Player of the Year award which included votes from fans on Twitter Weibo and WeChat went to Ronnie OSullivan who won the Masters and Welsh Open.
Darryl Hill from the Isle of Man won the Rookie of the Year award after climbing to nd place in the world rankings during his debut season.
The Magic Moment of the Year category was won by Ali Carter for winning the Paul Hunter Classic his first tournament victory since returning to the tour following battles with cancer.
Former World Champion Stuart Bingham was inducted into snookers Hall of Fame alongside Rex Williams and Sindhu Pulsirivong.
Snooker legend Steve Davis who announced his retirement last month was given a special Lifetime Achievement Award.
The awards ceremony at the Dorchester Hotel also helped raised money for Bluebell Wood Childrens Hospice which is World Snookers official charity for more details see
Im also not convinced that awarding John Higgins Player of the year for winning the Australian Open and International championship is the best choice. How is that better than winning the Champion of Champions and UK Championship Neil Robertson or the Masters and the Welsh Open Ronnie OSullivan Granted these are two ranking events but frankly the Austalian Open isnt the most prestigious or one with a particularly strong and motivated field. Both the UK Championship and the Masters are far more prestigious and coveted tittles than any Higgins won.
And for me the magic moment of the year was China Team B two teenagers celebrating their win over seasoned pros at the World Cup. The sheer delight of the two boys so genuine so refreshing so spontaneous it was infectious.
Also I believe that mentioning and rewarding how well Stuart Bingham acquitted himself of his ambassadorial duties as a World Chamoin should have been apprpriate.
Today Ronnie will be at Buckingham Palace to receive his OBE I wonder if he will wear a tie for the occasion.
And yes Ronnie said during the snooker awards ceremony that he will play more next season he needs to
How on earth was Higgins the player of the season Yes he wasnt bad in but he hasnt produced anything since last October
The best news is that Ronnie will play more tournaments next season. I guess that the many exhibitions which he played this year have damaged someway his safety game which was the only aspect of his game that didnt work against Barry Hawkins. I believe he needs more tournament practice.Best wishes for his visit at the Buckingham Palace for receiving the OBE title. He deserves it.

This outrageous award is the clearest evidence yet that the Tories think they can get away with whatever they like
The row over the honours system being used to reward Conservative Party cronies is set to be reignitedwith the revelation that almost Tory Party members or supporters have received awards.
Publication of the New Years Honours List confirms that the Australian political strategist Lynton Crosby is to be knighted for services to politics. It follows his short stint working for the Conservative Party earlier this year for which he was paid during which he successfully directed their General Election strategy resulting in an unexpected overall majority for David Cameron.
But analysis of the list shows that the future Sir Lynton is just one of many who have been honoured not for what they had done for the country but for their services to the Conservative Party.
Another Tory to receive a knighthood is Henry Bellingham an old Etonian who has been MP for Norfolk North West for years and was a junior foreign minister for two years. Two officials working for the Scottish Conservatives received the CBE Commander of the Order of the British Empire the highest award on offer below being made a knight or a dame. They are Mark McInnes director of the Scottish Conservatives since and James Stewart who was a director of a Londonbased equity firm when he took over as treasurer of the Scottish Tories in .
The socalled queen of the sex shop Jacqueline Gold chief executive of Ann Summers who is credited with changing the lingerie and sex toys retail chains brand image to make it more womenfriendly has also been made a CBE. Ms Gold and her father David Gold who made a fortune selling pornography are prominent donors to the Conservative Party. She appeared alongside George Osborne at a preelection Conservative press conference.
Two Conservative activists have received the next most prestigious order the OBE Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Marion Little is a long serving party organiser based at head office with the title campaign specialist and Dr Spencer Pitfield who ran against Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam in was director of the Conservative National Policy Forum in the run up to this years election.
Lyndon Jones for years leading figure in the Welsh Conservative Party and its current deputy chairman has been awarded an MBE Member of the Order of the British Empire. So has Christopher Fenwick a member of the family that owns the chain of department stores. His award for political service probably refers to his former role as Deputy Chairman of the secretive United and Cecil Club which raises hundreds of thousands of pounds a year for the Conservatives.
Sir Jonathan Stephens chairman of the main Honours Committee defended the latest list saying that only out of a total of names were being awarded for political services. They included Labours chief whip Rosie Winterton who has been made a Dame and the former Liberal Democrat MP and Energy Secretary Ed Davey who has been knighted and a handful of officials who have worked as parliamentary clerks or in similar roles.
Harriet Harmans former adviser Ayesha Hazarika has been awarded an MBE. Harman wanted her to be given a seat in the House of Lords in the August postelection honours list but Ed Miliband insisted on elevating his adviser Spencer Livermore instead.
Sir Jonathan also defended the high proportion of civil servants on the list insisting that each honour was awarded on merit after being examined by a scrutiny committee. However with thousands of families in the north still coping with the impact of floods some may ask whether this was the right time to announce that Neil OConnor a high ranking official at the Department for Communities and Local Government has been awarded a CBE for services to fire safety and flood resilience.
The highest award to any woman on the list went to Linda Homer the former head of HM Revenue and Customs who is made a DCB Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath for services to public finance. Appearing before the Commons Treasury committee last month Ms Homer said she was very apologetic for the poor service suffered by people trying to ring the tax office.
Sir Jonathan added that it was disappointing that three of the names had been leaked to Sunday newspapers. They were Lynton Crosby the actress Barbara Windsor who is to become Dame Barbara and the jockey Tony McCoy who will be Sir Tony. We ask each of the recipients to keep the award confidential and they do so of course and its just disappointing for them when something is preempted he said.
He also stressed that anyone can be nominated for an award and any member of the public wanting to make a nomination should log into the government website gov.uk.

A man who helped save Launceston from major floods distinguished medical experts and an internationallyrecognised artist are among the Tasmanians recognised in this years Queens Birthday honours list.
Last week saw the worst floods to hit Tasmania in nearly a century and when the flood levee gates held at Launceston on Wednesday morning Alan Birchmore had more reason than most to be relieved.
As chair of the Launceston Flood Authority he oversaw their construction in .
Most people dont achieve anything by themselves. The trick is really to get people to come along with you to travel the journey with you he said.
Mr Birchmore was named an Officer AO in the General Division for service to business in the maritime and mining sectors and for his work in flood mitigation.
The Australian Institute of Company Directors fellow said he grew up poor in an asbestos shack in Clarence Point. 
The beauty of Australia is theyll give you the benefit of what you can do rather than where youve come from he said.
It can be difficult but its also a challenge and its a wonderful way to care for people at their most vulnerable she said. 
Two leaders in the health sector Mike Ralston and Peter Mudge were among the five Tasmanians recognised as a Member AM in the General Division.
Emeritus Professor Peter Mudge helped shape the role of a General Practitioner in Australia. 
My most rewarding legacy is the people Ive mentored through my life Ive been able to help by giving them a job or helping them with their research he said.
Also recognised was Mr Ralston who boasts extensive experience in health governance particularly in the area of pathology. 
Fascinating and interesting and its a job that had to be done and I loved it so I just did it he said.
Rupert Woods was recognised for his service to veterinary science as a clinician and administrator.
But also his management of wildlife health particularly through his work in Antarctica developing a safer method to anaesthatise seals.
It was very challenging theyre very difficult animals to anaesthetise Mr Woods said.
In order to be able to get near them because they are big and dangerous you need to use chemical restraints.
The expert on mammal health also helped set up Wildlife Health Australia and is currently the CEO.
He hopes being appointed a Member of the Order of Australia will shed light on the tireless work of vets.
I believe it recognises all the unsung work that all the veterinarians around the country do. Dayin and dayout for everyone. Theyre the heroes out there Mr Woods said.
Mole Creekbased professional artist and aikido master Anthony Tony Smibert has been recognised for his contributions to both.
I came from a very academic family and I was the black sheep in terms of study and academia I just didnt get school 
But my parents encouraged us to be interested in something and expected if you were interested that you would persue it and if they could help you in any way they would.
And I married the right girl Carmel Burns another artist who backed and supported me in every possible way and who in fact should probably get this award not me.

Malcolm Turnbull wanted an exciting time. Hes got it writes Lateline political correspondent David Lipson.
One of Malcolm Turnbulls key reasons for calling a double dissolution election was to clean out the crossbench for a more functional Senate. The result is anything but.

As I said on the Filmfare Awards night its taken me years to win a trophy Yup this trophy means the world to me.
Vaastav was special. It took many meetings between Mahesh Manjrekar and me to crack the deal. However I knew there was potential in the role from day one. Also Maheshs enthusiasm was infectuous.
When we ran out of money halfway through the film making Mahesh was very upset but somehow we pulled through the crises.
Though I was still figuring out the character of Raghu in the first schedule I got under his skin soon after.
There were several disturbing moments in the film. After I shot the climax with Reema Lagoo I was a wreck for a few days. That scene drained me completely. The rushes of the scene gave me gooseflesh.
Vaastav made me aware of the vast untapped talent in the movie business. Sanjay Narvekar who played my best buddy Dedh Footiya is an amazing actor. So are Reema Lagoo and Shivaji Satham who played my parents. When I saw the kind of dedication these guys put into their work I gave up all starry nakhras.
For the first time my wardrobe didnt come from Gabbana or some hifi designer. Mahesh Manjrekar bought clothes from footpath shops. and he even made me wear his own colourful ganjis and shirts. Thats why I looked like an authentic chawlwala.
When shooting was stalled in between I was dejected. Id have given up and moved on because I had other projects on hand. But for Mahesh it was a doordie situation. Rhea also insisted that we revive Vaastav. She sensed the films potential. I cant thank her enough for this.
For the first five years of my career I was just treated as a star son. My physical attributes and my shenanigans made more news than my performances. But Mahesh Bhatt and Naam changes all that.
Naam made me realise that I had what it takes to be an actor. It was the rebirth of Sanjay Dutt. I felt dejected when I didnt win an award for Naam. And I also felt ignored when the same happened during Saajan Sadak Khalnayak and Hathyar. I got excellent reviews but no awards.
Im glad Vaastav has brought me recognition. Not only has it consolidated my position at the boxoffice but its also given me an incentive to do quality work.
I will never sleepwalk through a film. My learning process wont stop just because Ive won an award. Ive got to think beyond Vaastav now. My honeymoon with the camera will continue for a long long time.
There are not many authorbacked roles for me. But Im excited about Mission Kashmir Kurukshetra and Chal Mere Bhai.
Sanjay Dutt about his Zee Premiere Choice Award as Best Actor for Mission Kashmir 
I am very happy to have got this critics award. To me it is the highest accolade an actor can get. My growth as an actor has got a lot to do with the experiences Ive gone through. I think people who want to becone good actors should go to jail laughs. Such experiences make you grow fast and become mature. Life teaches you best. If you see Saajan Vaastav and Mission Kashmir you will find a dramatic change in the level of my performances. When Vinod Chopra narrated the story of Mission Kashmir to me I was impressed by the character of Inayat Khan and instantly accepted the film. Inayat was an honest yet complex character who goes through a series of battering in life and yet comes out a winner.
During the making of the film Vinod would occasionally ask me to write a scene and I would do it. One of them was when I come home after my wifes death. I get down to putting the house in order expecting her to return then suddenly remember that she is dead. The toughest part in the role was when I go to the bathroom and start crying after young Hrithik asks me whether those were my sons clothes. It was a very tricky scene the audience would either gone with it or laugh at it.
I signed Munnabhai M.B.B.S. because I loved the script. And once I started shooting for it the film grew on me the scenes the dialogues the chemistry and rapport with my costars Arshad Boman Jimmy and above all the guidance of Vidhu Vinod Chopra and my director Raju Rajkumar Hirani. I had such great fun working for the film that I used to look forward to another day of fun and laughter on the sets. This film also gave me an opportunity to face the camera with my Dad for the first time in my career. And that makes this film and this award a very very special award to me. And last but certainly not the least I thank the audience and my fans who voted for me since this award is based on the readers poll.
Sanjay Dutt about his Filmfare Best Actor In A Comic Role Award for Munnabhai M.B.B.S. 
To be honest I was disappointed at being nominated in the category of Best Actor In A Comic Role. I was taken aback by this nomination because I had not indulged in any kind of buffoonery in the film nor was I a comedian. I was the hero of the film. You know they dont have such categories abroad. An actor is an actor hes not compartmentalised into categories.
But Im not the kind of guy who takes things to heart and broods over them for too long. After a while I look at the positive side of things. Paresh Rawal Johnny Lever and Boman Irani the other actors nominated in that category are amazingly talented so I was in good company.
Believe me right from the time I started shooting for Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. I knew the film would do well. Rajkumar Hirani is a very talented guy and hes here to stay. And this film will always remain special for me because it was the first time I shot with my dad who played my father in the film.
I was a little reluctant to go for the award ceremony because Im a bit awkward at public functions and especially at award functions. I finally attended not because I expected to win but because I have a soft spot for Filmfare. Theres an emotional bond with the journalists from the magazine.
In fact I was not confident about winning the trophy at all. Everyone around was sure I would get it of course but when the nominations were announced I had my moments of Will I wont I I was really happy when my name was announced and it felt nice to hold the trophy in my hand. It means a lot when your hard work is noticed.
I was completely caught by surprise when it was announced that I have won this award. Im truly honoured to receive this award its very encouraging. Munnabhai is a role that Ive really enjoyed playing especially second time round. The character has become really popular and this validates the fact since its a readers choice award. And the fact that Ive won this award despite the presence of such strong contenders like Hrithik Shahrukh and Salman Khan has really taken me by surprise. Stardust is like family to me and Im really honoured.
Vidhu Vinod Chopra about Sanjay Dutts Zee Cine Critics Award for Lage Raho Munnabhai
Sanju you should have been here man This is such a wonderful moment Of all the awards we received and I got in my whole life this is the most precious because this man deserved this award for years applause And three cheers for Sanjay Dutt hipp hipp hurrah Got it man you deserve it Thank you everybody
It was a great honour for me to enact the role of Munnabhai in Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Doing the film was a learning experience for me. Gandhism is relevant today and will always remain relevant. I believe in nonviolence peace and let people live. Both my mother and father were Gandhians.
Mewa Lal Gupta of the Gandhi Vichar Andolan about honoring Sanjay Dutt for Lage Raho Munnabhai
We have taken note of the fact that what the entire nation could not do in independent India has been achieved by Sanjay Dutt through his role as Munna Bhai. The extent to which the message of Mahatma Gandhi could be spread through the film was incredible. I am really impressed by the overwhelming impact the film made on the minds of common people. As far as we are concerned we see enough reason to felicitate the man who deserves praise for effectively spreading the message of the father of the nation. Sanjay has done something that books visuals and other laudable efforts could not achieve over the decades.
Dutt has been constantly reinventing himself and is always a step ahead of all competition. He was the first one to work out for a great physique to get a tattoo and to get his hair streaked. His constant experimentation with his looks work so well that after a time it becomes a trend says his good friend and director Sanjay Gupta. Even at he can beat the hell out of all the younger guys when it comes to style which is why Sanjay Dutt was the choice for MTVs Most Stylish Person male for .

The Society of Interventional Radiology SIR has awarded John Kaufman with the Dr Charles T Dotter Lecture for his extraordinary career achievement and contributions to the specialty. The SIR has also given Gold Medals to Dimitrios Kelekis and Louis Martin for their contributions in advancing the quality of medicine and patient care. Interventional News spoke to them
John Kaufman has been chosen to deliver the Charles Dotter Lecture at the SIR annual meeting.
Kaufman is professor and Frederick S Keller endowed chair of interventional radiology at Dotter Interventional Institute and professor of radiology professor of surgery and professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Sciences University Portland USA. He is also currently chief of vascular and interventional radiology and associate director of the Dotter Interventional Institute. In this interview he told Interventional News the SIR award Is a great personal and professional honour. I just hope that someone has not seriously misjudged me and that my lecture will not be too boring
The cases that stand out in memory are not always the most dramatic or heroic. If I had to pick one it would be a current patient an yearold with very bulky primary hepatoma not fibrolamellar. The patient has absolutely no risk factors which lead to a significant delay in diagnosis. We are slowly working through multiple liver directed therapies and getting a good response in terms of imaging and symptoms. But what really stands out is this young persons courage and resolve to be a normal yearold in the face of something so inexplicably unfair as hepatoma. We need to remember always that we treat patients not lesions or diseases.
The first was when Charles Dotter dilated an artery in this created an entirely new and fundamental approach to patient care the use of imaging to guide intervention rather than just make a diagnosis. I do not have a date for the next critical moment but it was when cardiology replaced radiology as provider of cardiac catheterisation a clear signal that has been repeated many times that technical expertise is not enough to maintain a role in the procedures that we develop. And of course when the American Board of Radiology awarded the first subspecialty certificates in vascular and interventional radiology formalising recognition of interventional radiology by all of the other boards in medicine.
We must be able to show that SIR president Tim Murphys summation of interventional radiology as faster safer better cheaper is actually true.
We have one of the best jobs in medicine with a great future let us work to keep it that way.
Born on August in Thessaloniki Macedonia Greece Dimitrios Kelekis is the first interventional radiologist in a family of three generations of radiologists. Widely regarded as a pioneer of interventional radiology in Greece he has served as president of the Hellenic Society of Interventional Radiology Vascular Radiology and Neuroradiology for many years and is respected as a teacher to many generations of interventional radiologists. Kelekis was professor of Radiology University of Athens Greece president of the CIRSE annual meeting in in Crete and will be awarded the SIR Gold Medal in .
Kelekis recalls Philippe Bussat was my first teacher in angiography in . I was also influenced and impressed by the work of Anders Lunderquist Erik Boisen and Erikson. A very important influence was the Paris School with Hernandez and Escoffier as also Professor Zeitler. He also had the joy of working with Andreas Gruentzig. I had the privilege to meet and work with Andreas Gruentzig from whom I learnt percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Christos Athanasoulis and his team in MGH were fundamental to my evolution as an interventionalist.
During my residence in Geneva I was impressed by the potential of interventional radiology and it was more suitable to my active character said Kelekis. Now his son Alexis Kelekis his daughterinlaw and two nephews plus their families are part of a family of six active radiologists who provide the third generation of imagers and second generation of interventional radiologists
My father wanted to be a doctor but he graduated from high school during the Depression and could not go to college. He never pressured me to go into medicine but I knew it would make him very happy if I did so every time I had an academic choice to make I just kept gravitating in that direction.
I think we do very poorly in evaluating our complications to interventional procedures.

Library and Archives Canada LAC holds medal registers citation cards and the records of various military awards. As there are no service files for the Canadian military in the s those records often provide the only proof of service for th century conflicts. Many of the medals were awarded to recognize active service rather than acts of bravery. For example all those who served in the North West Rebellion were entitled to the North West Canada Medal.
The names of the recipients of the Queens South African Medal are indexed in our South African War database and the registers have been digitized.
Many of the medal registers are very fragile oversized ledgers some of which such as those available on microfilm have been digitized. A number of the medals registers have been indexed and included in this database see below.
Library and Archives Canada also holds the following records that have not yet been indexed yet and are therefore not included in this database.
The citation cards mostly relate to the First World War and the Second World War . That collection consists of boxes of x inch cards. Most references relate to a single card and some have notations on the back side. Only some cards explain the reason why the honour or the award was granted. With a few rare exceptions the citation cards relate only to the Canadian Army. For the Air Force and Navy consult the links at the end of this page under Other Resources.
Some entries only include an initial for the given names. Try searching by surname only. Names can also be spelled different ways. The entries reflect the spelling of names as they appear on the documents. You can try spelling variations of names or use the wildcard character.
Also the citation cards cannot be searched by regiment because that information was not captured when the database was created.
