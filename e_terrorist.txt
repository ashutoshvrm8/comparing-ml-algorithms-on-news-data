The office of satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo is attacked by gunmen killed.
By Mohamed Madi Sherie Ryder Julia Macfarlane Alastair Beach and Victoria Park
Were bringing to an end our live text coverage of a gun attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris which left people dead. French police are still hunting for two brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi in connection with the attack after another suspect reportedly handed himself in. Well continue to bring you updates on our 
Police officers stand guard outside a flat in Reims as investigators search inside. 
French police have released these photos of the two brothers wanted in connection with the attacks. Cherif Kouachi l is and his brother Said is .
French police have issued arrest warrants for brothers Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi AFP says. They have appealed to the public for information but warned that the men were likely armed and dangerous.
A hashtag called MouradHamydInnocent is trending in France reportedly started by classmates of yearold Hamyd Mourad who say they were in class with him at the time of the attack.
Hamyd Mourad the youngest of the three suspects. has surrendered to police sources tell AFP.
Rallies condemning the attack are taking place across the world including this one in Quebec Canada.
Police say the three suspects they are pursuing in connection with the attack are Hamyd Mourad and brothers Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi.
French soldiers disembark at Le Bourget airport north of Paris as part of a deployment of soldiers to enhance security in Paris.
AFP has more details from that police raid reportedly taking place in Reims in northeastern France. A member of Frances elite antiterror unit has called on journalists at the scene to remain vigilant warning that there would a showdown or that the suspects could escape the agency says. 
Police say an antiterror raid is under way in the northeastern city of Reims according to the AFP news agency.
BBC correspondent Fergal Keane reports that tensions over the role of Islam have sharpened in France over recent years.
In response to Wednesdays attack at least three Danish newspapers are planning to print copies of cartoons from Charlie Hebdo according to the BBCs Malcolm Brabant in Copenhagen.
But none of the Copenhagen press are planning to reprint the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that ignited anger in some areas of the Muslim world seven years ago. Yet security has been tightened at all of the countrys media outlets as a result of the massacre.
The editor of the tabloid BT said he would be running with Charlie Hebdos most controversial cover one that showed a weeping Muhammad overwhelmed by fundamentalists lamenting that it was hard being loved by idiots.
Former CIA counterterrorism analyst Aki Peritz tells BBC World News that that the attacks appear to have been very professional well thought out well researched and well executed.
He says it is significant that apart from the police the only other targets were journalists and nobody else inside the Charlie Hebdo office was killed. 
The Paris Normandie newspaper has expressed its solidarity with those killed in todays attack publishing a front page which alters the name of the publication in honour of Charlie Hebdo. 
The BBCs Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says that the Charlie Hebdo attack 
Reuters is reporting more details on the three suspects being sought by French police. Officers are looking for two brothers in the Paris region and another man in the northeastern city of Reims according to the news agency. It quotes a government source as saying the two brothers are and years of age and the third suspect is years old.
The killings at Charlie Hebdo are a deeply unwelcome reminder to the west that for some mainly young radicalised men their fundamentalist interpretation of their religion matters enough to kill those who offend it.
As a result across western Europe liberallyminded societies are beginning to divide over how best to deal with radical Islamism and its impact on their countries while governments agonise over the potential for a backlash against Muslims living in Europe.
Today mainstream Muslim organisations in the UK and France have unequivocally condemned the killings saying that terrorism is an affront to Islam.
But the potential backlash including support for far right parties and groups may well hurt ordinary Muslims more than anyone else leaving the authorities and religious leaders in western Europe wondering how to confront violence in the name of religion without victimizing minorities or being accused of Islamophobia.
The BBCs Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield says that France has just lived through one of those days which remain engraved in the national memory.
Soon there will be the discordant voices. On the one hand there will be those saying the real lesson of the attack is that France should drop its naivety concerning Islamism in the banlieues.
On the other side there will be those warning against what the French call lamalgame i.e. lumping all Muslims together and claiming that the problem resides somewhere with their religion.
Terrorism is classified as fourthgeneration warfare and as a violent crime. In its broadest sense is defined as the use of violence or threatened use of violence terror often targeting civilians in order to achieve a political religious or ideological aim. In modern times terrorism is considered a major threat to society and therefore illegal under antiterrorism laws in most jurisdictions. It is also considered a war crime under the laws of war when used to target noncombatants such as civilians neutral military personnel or enemy prisoners of war.
A broad array of political organizations have practiced terrorism to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both rightwing and leftwing political organizations nationalist groups religious groups revolutionaries and ruling governments. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.
In a suspected terror attack on Monday gunmen fired indiscriminately in Punjabs Dinanagar town in the frontier district of Gurdaspur leaving six dead including police officials. Dinanagar town is close to the Jammu and Kashmir border. 
All militants were killed and another seriously injured in the gunbattle with security forces that stretched for over hours as the terrorists who went on a rampage at around a.m. were holed up in a vacant building adjacent to Dinanagar police station. 
The gunmen have killed seven persons three civilians and four policemen including Superintendent of Police Detective Baljit Singh. 
This is a zone which has been vulnerable for quite some time. There have been reports of Pak infiltration earlier also Jitendra Singh told the media. 
He said that ministry of home affairs has taken note of it and the government of India is capable enough to deal with such situation.

We were hit by a burst of gunfire suddenly. I was hit on the shoulder. They are firing indiscriminately every five minutes a Punjab police official who was injured in the attack told media as he was being taken to the hospital. 
The bombs were carefully wired to the railway track at a small bridge near Parmanand railway station five km from Dinanagar. 
A train which was to pass on the railway track was stopped just metres from the spot where the bombs were planted.

Franoise Schepmans mayor of Molenbeek a Brussels district dubbed a terrorists den due its links with jihadists has admitted receiving a list with the names and addresses of more than people suspected as Islamic militants living in her area. 
This included Abdelhamid Abaaoud a Molenbeek resident who had left for Syria to fight for the Islamic State in early and was killed last week outside Paris along with Brahim Abdeslam who blew himself up on the boulevard Voltaire and his brother Salah Abdeslam currently on the run. 
Belgium has come under criticism in France over its perceived intelligence failings before and after the attacks with Le Monde newspaper calling it a clearing house for jihadism that risks becoming a fractious nation without a state. 
The Belgian capital has been under the highestlevel threat alert since Saturday meaning that authorities fear a serious and imminent attack. Yet schools and subways began reopening across the city on Wednesday despite the fact that Salah Abdeslam is still on the run along with another suspect named as Mohamed Abrini seen driving a car with Abdeslam two days before the atrocities. 
Mohamed Adbeslam the brother of terrorists Salah and Brahim on Wednesday confirmed having met Abrini but denied any knowledge of the terror plot saying he thought his brothers were going skiing. 
He even claimed to have received messages of support from the families of victims. 
Fortunately there are many people who believe me and I get a lot of messages of support from a lot of French in particular families of victims he said. 
I totally understand their anger against me and my family. But I also want to tell them that while unfortunately we did nothing we did not want what happened in Paris.

The Eagles of Death Metal were inspired by the shared heroism they witnessed during the Bataclan theatre massacre and cant wait to return to the venue to play once more. 
Members of the band hid and others attempted to flee as gunfire rang out suddenly during their performance and they became witnesses to the horror that would ultimately claim lives in the bloodiest of the November attacks in Paris. 
The fear and confusion the band felt as Jihadists fired indiscriminately on the crowd in the iconic rock venue have been replaced in the days since by grief and defiance. 
I want to be the first band to play in the Bataclan when it opens back up because I was there when it went silent for a minute Jesse Hughes the bands front man told Vice in an interview released on Wednesday. 
The Mayor of the Brussels district of Molenbeek received a list with the names of more than suspected jihadists living in the area just one month before the Paris attacks. The New York Times reported that on this list attacks mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud and the two brothers who took part Brahim and Salah Abdeslam who remains at large. Their apartment was just metres from the Mayors office and could be viewed from her window.

Last night we learned that the suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks Abaaoud returned to the Bataclan concert venue while a police operation to kill the remaining gunmen was still under way. This meant he was there minutes before President Hollande was in the vicinity. 
We also learned that police are searching for another man in connection with the Paris attacks. Mohammad Abrini Belgian of Moroccan origin was seen by police on video footage at a car fuelling station in Ressons a town north of Paris on the day before the attacks. The Renault Clio the two were seen in was one of the cars used in the attacks. A Belgian police notice describes Abrini as dangerous and probably armed.

He insists he had no idea his brothers were planning the atrocity and has said they told their mother they were going skiing before the attack. 
Fortunately there are many people who believe me and I get a lot of messages of support from a lot of French in particular families of victims he said.

But most of the tube lines are running and police have been deployed to guard schools which are open. 
The ministry of health has warned the emergency services to be on guard for attacks. 
It has also told fire stations to secure their equipment to prevent it being stolen allowing terrorists to pose as fire officers. 
The Mayor of the Brussels district of Molenbeek received a list with the names of more than suspected jihadists living in the area just one month before the Paris attacks. 
The New York Times reports that the list included the two brothers who took part in the attacks Brahim and Salah Abdeslam as well as Abdelhamid Abaaoud the suspected mastermind. 
He was a Molenbeek resident who left for Syria to join the socalled Islamic State in .

Speaking in the European parliament in session to mark the Paris attacks the president of the European Commission responded to parties such as Ukip who argue that Schengen has granted free movement of jhad. 
Please dont get things mixed up. We should not exploit in an absurd manner these tragic events said Juncker. 
We have to safeguard the spirit behind Schengen. Yes the Schengen system is partly comatose. But those who believe in Europe its values its principles and its freedoms must try to breath new life into the spirit behind Schengen. 
A single currency does not exist if Schengen fails. It is not a neutral concept. It is not banal. It is one of the pillars of the construction of Europe. 
The brother of a fugitive Paris attack suspect is urging him to surrender to police immediately. 
Mohamed Abdeslam said on RTL radio today that he shares the pain of victims families and wishes he and his family could have done something to prevent the bloodshed across Paris on November . 
Abdeslam had two brothers involved in the attacks. Brahim Abdeslam blew himself up in front of a Paris cafe and Salah Abdeslam is believed to have been another potential bomber but escaped the scene. An international warrant is out for his arrest. 
Let him turn himself in for his parents for justice for the families of victims so that we can find out what happened Mohamed Abdeslam said. 
He said he saw his brothers a few days before they left their Brussels suburb for Paris but had no idea what they were plotting and hasnt heard from Salah since.

In all security forces will be deployed around the country said Bernard Cazeneuve the French interior minister. 
German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday that Berlin will contribute up to soldiers to the Frenchled operation against jihadists in Mali. 
The move is aimed partly at providing some relief to France in its global fight against the Islamic State jihadists according to German news agency DPA quoting the minister following a parliamentary defence committee meeting. 
Abaaoud and the unidentified individual both died last Wednesday during a police assault on a flat in SaintDenis a northern Paris suburb. 
Students in Brussels have begun returning to class after a twoday shutdown over fears that a series of simultaneous attacks could be launched around the Belgian capital. 
Special measures are being taken at primary and secondary schools plus universities with student movements limited around or outside school buildings during the day. 
Underground transport in Brussels is also slowly starting up again after a fourday closure. Sections of the main metro are in operation but services are not running to outlying suburbs. 
Belgian authorities set the city on maximum alert overnight on Friday amid warnings of an imminent security threat. More than security personnel and soldiers have been deployed. 
Henry Samuel in Paris writes that the suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks returned to the Bataclan concert venue while a police operation to kill the remaining gunmen was still under way the Paris prosecutor has revealed. 
Telephone analysis shows that Abdelhamid Abaaoud had returned to the area around the scene where people were killed by three assailants while police were still attempting to free hostages on November . 
This means that he was in the vicinity within minutes of President Franois Hollande who insisted on showing up to offer support to victims and police shortly after the terrorists were killed. 
The Isil terrorist also visited the scene where minutes earlier he and at least two other terrorists opened fire on Parisians in cafes and restaurants in the th and th arrondissements. 
Franois Molins the Paris prosecutor said that Abaaoud had boarded a metro going back to the centre of Paris and the phone he was believed to be using was detected in the th th and th districts and by the Bataclan concert hall while attacks there ongoing. 
He revisited the area while the BRI elite police unit was still on the scene he said. 
Abaaoud was among three people who died during a police raid on a flat in SaintDenis a northern Paris suburb in the days after the attacks. One of the three has still not been identified but is believed to have died when a suicide vest exploded. 
Investigators are convinced Abaaoud and the unidentified man were planning a suicide attack on the French capitals La Defense business district on November or Mr Molins added. 
Meanwhile the hunt continued for suspect Salah Abdeslam who fled to Belgium after apparently jettisoning his suicide vest. Belgian authorities issued an international arrest warrant for a dangerous man seen driving a car with Abdeslam two days before the atrocities. 
Mohamed Abrini was filmed along with Abdeslam at a petrol station in Ressons France on the motorway to Paris in a Renault Clio which was later used in the attacks Belgiums federal prosecutor said in a statement. 
However Mr Hollande ruled out sending French ground forces. Local forces on the ground that we have accompanied will do this work on the ground once we have hit Isil with airstrikes he said. 
Mr Hollande said it was urgent to shut the border between Syria and Turkey so that no terrorist comes notably to Europe to perpetrate barbaric attacks like those we have known. 
Both called on Bashar al Assads departure as part of a political solution to the Syrian crisis but neither would put a time frame on this with Mr Hollande merely saying as soon as possible. 
President Barack Obamas national security team believes there is no specific credible threat to the United States from Islamic State the White House said Tuesday amid stepped up coalition strikes on the extremist group.

We strongly condemn cowardly attack on innocent ppl in Punjab. We are with the people of Punjab and hope that culprits wud soon be nabbed
Will be very interested to see what emerges about the identity of the terrorists involved in the Gurdaspur attack this morning 
The timing of the attack methodology location are all eerily similar to attacks in the border belt of Jammu 
While initial reports suggest that the terrorists infiltrated from adjoining Hiranagar area of Jammu and entered Punjab near Pathankot intelligence sources say the possibility of infiltration having taken place on the PunjabJK border south of Hiranagar cannot be ruled out.
There are several riverine areas along with international border in this area where monsoon affords a possibility to cross due to swollen Ravi river and tall grass. The BSF too is forced to move back in these areas as their posts get flooded informed a senior military officer over phone.
Sources say that the Army has moved in its Special Forces troops by helicopter from nearby Jammu to take over the operation of flushing out the terrorists from the police station and neutralising them. Special Forces bomb disposal squads and other support elements of the Army are expected to reach the encounter site any time soon.
The MHA is monitoring the situation in Gurudaspur and Punjab. I am confident that the situation will be soon brought in control.

There were seven coordinated terror attacks in Paris carried out by militants killing at least people. 
The first attacks were launched virtually simultaneously with two explosions close to the Stade de France at just after .pm local time four miles apart. 
The explosions came as a large crowd were enjoying the first half of the international friendly between France and Germany. 
The attacks then moved to central Paris where a separate team of gunmen arrived in a black Seat at the Right Bank area of the city. 
The attackers opened fire on the Petit Cambodge Cambodian restaurant in Rue Bichat and the Le Carillon bar on the other side of the road. 
With devastating coolness they gunned down diners and revellers at the two venues killing as many enjoyed their Friday night out. 
The fourth attack came on Rue de la Fontaine au Roi when the same unit of terrorists drove the yards to the Casa Nostra pizzeria and opened fire on diners killing at least five. 
From there the militants drove around a mile southeast apparently past the area of the Bataclan concert venue to then launch another attack this time on La Belle Equipe bar in Rue de Charonne. At least people died after the terrace was sprayed with bullets at around .pm. 
The next attack at the Bataclan concert venue in Boulevard Voltaire was the most deadly. There at least people lost their lives when they were shot by blackclad gunmen wielding AKs and wearing suicide vests. 
The attackers stormed into the hall and fired calmly and methodically at hundreds of screaming concertgoers who were watching the US rock group Eagles of Death Metal playing to a full house of people. 
They began a siege that would last two hours and forty minutes. Two of the militants blew up their explosive belts as heavily armed antiterror police ended the siege at around .am. A third was shot by officers. 
Terrifying details have emerged of the police assault on the Islamist attackers. 
The first policeman to get there arrived at pm about minutes after the three gunmen burst into the concert hall last Friday night and began methodically killing fans who had turned out to watch the Eagles of Death Metal group. 
At around . pm a heavily armed Swat team arrived and entered the building. The attackers had by then retreated to an upper floor. The police evacuated all the people they found and then in two columns went up the stairs to the right and the left of the auditorium. 
As they progressed terrified people emerged from cupboards and other hiding places where they had taken cover. 
They came out like zombies. They were in a terrible state and could hardly walk said one officer involved in the raid named only as Jean. 
At minutes past midnight the order was given to start the final assault. The police burst open the door and protected by a heavy metal shield being advancing down the corridor that was revealed to be full of about hostages. 
The attackers opened fire immediately but the police unit kept advancing with officers rushing screaming hostages out as they went forward. 
When finally they were face to face with the attackers the police threw a stun grenade as they blasted their guns at the Islamists. 
One attacker went down and then the other detonated his suicide vest blowing both their bodies to pieces. The assault had lasted three minutes. 
Finally at around .pm a third blast took place near the Stade de France this time by a McDonalds restaurant on the fringes of the stadium. 
The boom caused terror among spectators who had already been attempting to flee the stadium following the first two explosions. 
The match had continued with many attributing the initial noises to fireworks but word soon spread of what had taken place outside the stadium as people read updates on their mobile phones. 
Read a full reconstruction of what happened on the night of Friday November here. 
At least people have died according to city officials with many still in intensive care. 
One Briton Nick Alexander has been confirmed by family to have lost his life at the Bataclan. 
At least people were killed in the concert hall. Three assailants were also killed after police stormed in two by activating their suicide vests and a third shot dead. 
A little further east at least people died when the terrace of the La Belle Equipe in Rue de Charonne was sprayed with gunfire while people were killed at Le Carillon barcafe in Rues Bichat. 
Five people at the Casa Nostra pizzeria and a nearby bar were killed by attackers wielding rifles. 
The Molenbeek area of Brussels has continued to see a major crackdown with raids continuing overnight and throughout the day yesterday. 
On Sunday afternoon French media reported that three brothers may be involved in the attacks and one may remain at large. 
Ibrahim Abdeslam was a suicide bomebr who blew himself up outside the Comptoir Voltaire restaurant in Paris. He rented the Seat Leon which was found abandoned in a Paris suburb with Kalashnikovs inside. 
There is an international arrest warrant out for Salah Abdeslam a French national who rented a black VW Polo in Belgium which was found abandoned near the Bataclan concert hall. 
He was stopped near the Belgian border on Saturday morning in a grey VW golf also carrying two accomplices but was not arrested at the time. 
The third brother Mohamed Abdeslam was arrested on Saturday in Brussels but was released on Monday without charge. 
He has since released a statement saying he had no idea that his brothers had been radicalised. 
On Tuesday he called for his brother suspect Salah Abdeslam to turn himself in. 
French media reported on Tuesday Salah Abdeslam that he rented two rooms in Alfortville near Paris. 
According to news channel BFM TV he used a credit card to rent the flat and police say there is evidence he was not alone. 
Le Point claims it has exclusive video inside the rooms which are sparse with pizza boxes and syringes lying around. 
Brother of two Paris attack suspects Mohammed Abdeslam was arrested and then let go by the police. Here he speaks outside the family home
There are unconfirmed reports that Abdeslam is also on the run from Isil fearing that the jihadists will wreak retribution on him for not completing his tasks. 
Omar Ismail Mostefai was identified by his finger which was found among the rubble of the Bataclan concert hall. Police say he was one of three men who blew himself up killing people in the bloodiest scene of the carnage. His father and brother who handed himself in are in custody and police are searching the familys home and the homes of his friends. 
His brother told AFP that he had not seen Mostefai for years and said the attacks were madness. 
Born on November in the poor Paris suburb of Courcouronnes Mostefais criminal record shows eight convictions for petty crimes between and but no jail time. 
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Mostefai had been singled out as a highpriority target for radicalisation in but before Friday he had never been implicated in an investigation or a terrorist association. 
Investigators are now probing whether he took a trip to Syria last year according to police sources. 
Bilal Hadfi blew himself up outside gate H of the Stade de France. He is said to have fought with Isil in Syria and came from Belgium. 
A teacher at a school he attended told the Telegraph Hadfi was an unambitious loner who wanted to be a lorry driver after failing his exams. 
Ahmad Al Mohammad died in a suicide bomb at the Stade de France. A Syrian passport bearing his name was found at the scene. 
The yearold was born in Idlib a city in northwest Syria and the Paris prosecutors office said fingerprints from the attacker match those of a person who travelled through Greece last month. 
Sami Amimour was one of the suicide bombers who blew himself up at the Bataclan music hall the Paris prosecutors office said. A yearold Frenchman he was known to French intelligence services. 
He was charged with terror offences in and was placed under judicial supervision. But he later disappeared and an international arrest warrant was issued for him. 
Belgian Abdelhamid Abaaoud was named by a French official as the suspected mastermind of the Paris attacks. The official said he has been linked to thwarted attacks on a Parisbound highspeed train and a church in the Paris area. 
Two terror suspects have been killed and seven arrested in a raid by elite French SWAT forces at Saint Denis a northeastern Paris suburb targeting Abaaoud. 
An unidentified person blew themself up seconds after police opened fire at around .am local time in du Courbillon in the multiethnic working class district that is a stones throw from the Stade de France where three suicide bombers blew themselves up on Friday outside a FranceGermany friendly football game attended by president Francois Hollande. 
A police sniper shot dead a second suspect later on. A third person Hasna Aitboulahcen cousin of Abaaoud died. 
Police arrested three men they found in the apartment but there has no been no confirmation as to who they were. At least one perhaps two suspects are reportedly still holed up in the apartment. 
Police came under heavy Kalashnikov fire when they initially tried to enter the flat. Three officers suffered light injuries in the operation that was still ongoing at . am local time six hours after it began. 
The terror suspects killed and arrested on Wednesday were in the final stages of carrying out an imminent attack at Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport which is near SaintDenis and a shopping centre in La Dfense the capitals business district according to France the main state broadcaster. 
Citing police sources France said investigators believe the SaintDenis suspects formed part of a fourth team on top of the three that took part in Fridays attacks in Paris and the Stade de France which killed . 
As well as the airport the terrorist suspects had intended to strike the Quatre Temps shopping centre in La Dfense to the West of the capital. 
On Wednesday morning police searched two locations at Roissy including the cargo branch of Air France. However the Paris airport security authority said these had no direct link to the terror attacks but had other aims notably the search for elements linked to the phenomenon of radicalisation without providing more details. 
Earlier bomb threats forced two Air France flights bound from America for Paris to be diverted on Tuesday night. 
An Air France jet from Los Angeles International Airport landed in Salt Lake City while another from Washington Dulles International Airport landed in Halifax Nova Scotia. 
The aircraft were searched after they landed and no explosives were found on either plane police and airport officials said. 
The flights were subjects of anonymous threats received by phone after takeoff Air France spokesperson Christophe Paumier said. 
With seven suicide bombers dead seven others under arrest and at least one man on the run men have so far been linked to the Paris attacks. 
But CCTV footage suggests that there may have been a ninth attacker who is still at large. 
And Belgian intelligence officials have suggested that up to people may have been part of the terrorist cell that planned the attacks. 
A passport found near one of the suicide bombers at the Stade de France bore the name of Ahmad alMohammad. 
It was used to register a refugee on the Greek island of Leros on October and was then traced to Macedonia and an asylum claim in Serbia. 
American intelligence officials have reported that the passport was clearly fake based on the sequence of its serial number something not apparently picked up on as its holder made his way through Europe.

They were arrested after an employee at a local supermarket saw the group and believed she recognised the man as Salah Abdeslam the suspected Paris attacker who is on the run the magazine reported on its website. 
It is not currently clear whether the arrested man is Abdeslam using an alias or the arrests are a case of mistaken identity. 
Another man of Moroccan descent has been charged for terrorist offences in relation to the attacks. A. Lazez a yearold from Brussels was on Friday charged with helping organise the Paris attacks being part of a terrorist organisation and illegally carrying a weapon. 
Turkey has detained a Belgian citizen of Moroccan origin on suspicion of links to the Paris attacks. Ahmet Dahmani is accused of conducting reconnaissance work to choose the sites for the attacks in Paris and was caught trying to head into Syria. He has not been charged.

Reuters is reporting that a senior Turkish official twice notified France about a suspect in December and June . 
The official also said that they received a request from France on Omar Ismail Mostefai after the attacks. 
We did however not hear back from France on the matter added the official. 
The Turkish official confirmed that Mostefai entered Turkey from the northwestern province of Edirne that borders EU members Greece and Bulgaria in . 
The official said that French authorities had only showed interest in Mostefai after the attacks. 
It was only after the Paris attacks that the Turkish authorities received an information request about Omar Ismail Mostefai from France. 
He said that on October Turkey received an information request regarding four terror suspects from the French authorities but not for Mostefai even though he had been identified by Turkey as a potential terror suspect. 
French people gathered together on Sunday night in Paris to mourn the people who lost their lives in the attacks. 
A service was held at Notre Dame Cathedral and hundreds of people congregated at the Place de la Republique. 
Inside President Hollande marked a minutes silence for Fridays victims but outside more than a thousand students entirely packed the square which fell utterly still at midday. 
A minute later the applause rang out. One woman who was sobbing still put her hands together determined to make some noise to do something amid such helplessness. 
Soon everyone joined in some even shouted the words. All knew it by heart but never before had it felt so potent. 
When the singing ceased there were two more even louder rounds of applause. 
The students here were the same age as many killed on Friday but they will not be silenced.

Mohamed Khoualed handed himself in to police on Wednesday three days after police raided his flat in this town on the Belgian border. 
Police found explosives and detonators in the studio behind a drab redbrick house in a suburb of Roubaix one of Frances poorest towns and the one with the countrys highest percentage of Muslims. 
It is not known whether he is linked to the Paris attacks directly but judicial sources in Belgium said they believe Khoualed had been in contact with Salah Abdeslam the Belgian fugitive suspected of a leading role in the attacks. 
There were always dodgylooking people coming and going from the house that is split into several flats said one neighbour who declined to give her name. 
I thought it was more likely to be drug dealing than Islamists said another also asking for her name not be published. 
The government in Berlin is considering deploying troops on the streets of Germany for the first time since the war because of the terrorist threat. 
The move would be controversial in a country which has consciously shunned militarism in an effort to put distance between modern Germany and its Nazi past. 
Tension has been raised in the country and on Tuesday night a friendly football Germany and Holland match was cancelled minutes before kick off amid fears that terrorists were planning an outrage at or near the stadium in Hanover. 
A fivemember cell led by a German citizen was planning a total of five bomb attacks in the city Hannoverische Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported citing unnamed French security sources.

The bombs were to be smuggled into the stadium in a vehicle authorised to enter or by a cell member with a ticket.

For the second straight day the Indian Air Force IAF air base here remained the scene of intense gun battles after at least two more terrorists emerged from hiding overnight and engaged security forces throughout Sunday.
The total number of security personnel killed in the operation went up to seven Lt Col Niranjan Kumar of the National Security Guard NSG five Defence Security Corps DSC personnel and an Air Force Garud commando.
Officials said in the evening that the operation was continuing but played down concerns over the rising military casualties and why it was taking so long to take back control. They said the operation was heading towards completion and the terrorists had been prevented from reaching their main target the technical area of the airport.
Meanwhile Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with top officials including National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar to discuss the attack on Sunday night. Earlier in the day Modi was briefed by Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.
Addressing a briefing in Delhi Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi said five NSG personnel including Lt Col Niranjan Kumar were injured in an accidental grenade explosion while checking the body of a dead terrorist at am on Sunday. The officer later succumbed to his injuries.
Eight IAF and NSG personnel have been injured. One of the injured Naik Sri Mallu has been airlifted to Chandigarh.
Air Marshal Anil Khosla Director General of Air Operations said the operation is at a mature stage but we give a confirmation only once we physically see the bodies of the terrorists. He added Only once the whole area is sanitised and checked can we say there were only six terrorists.
So far the bodies of four terrorists have been recovered from the area of operation. The operation is on and is heading towards completion said J S Dhamoon Air Officer Commanding at Pathankot.
The firing inside the base continued throughout the day near an area where the terrorists are said to have first entered. A number of blasts could be heard. The security forces are reported to have demolished a building that was being used by the terrorists.
IAF attack helicopters were pressed into service once again on Sunday morning. The helicopters widened the surveillance to include the area around the adjoining Akalgarh village where the terrorists abandoned a vehicle that they had snatched from a police official on Friday.
Police and security personnel sealed the village from all sides as helicopters carried out the surveillance and contingents of the army BSF and Punjab police were deployed in different layers around the village and IAF station.
Giving an account of how the attack took place Dhamoon said four terrorists moving in a group first opened fire on the windows of a facility in the air base. They headed towards the DSC mess where they opened indiscriminate fire he said adding that one DSC jawan ran towards the last of the four militants and jostled with him killing the terrorist with the terrorists rifle. Dhamoon said the DSC jawan was killed by a bullet fired by one of the terrorists.
While three other terrorists were killed on Saturday Mehrishi said at that point they were not certain whether there were other terrorists or not. But the operation was slowed down to avoid unnecessary risk to security personnel he said.
Due to the active intelligence input advance information and quick action by security forces especially the Air Force we were able to ensure that there was no damage to the assets of the Air Force. Therefore the apparent main aim of the terrorists stands defeated he said.
Asked if the number of casualties suffered by the security forces despite an intelligence alert pointed to a lapse the Home Secretary said I do not consider it a lapse at all. In such a situation when weapons are in use some injuries and some deaths are bound to take place.
On how the terrorists managed to enter the IAF base despite intelligence and prepositioning of the NSG Mehrishi said The exact point of attack in Pathankot was not known. So NSG was there waiting for instructions basically on alert and on standby mode. The NSG entered the IAF base the moment the attack took place. There was no way of knowing whether the attack would be on the Air Force or Army.
Mehrishi said a terror alert was sounded in all vital installations and government offices immediately after Punjab police relayed information about two incidents between Gurdaspur and Pathankot a murder and a carjacking involving four men in army fatigues.
Efforts were mounted to reconfirm the infiltration and also see which direction the terrorists had taken and what their location might be said Mehrishi.
By afternoon when their location was tracked to Pathankot a meeting was held at the level of the NSA and was attended by all concerned including the Chief of Army Staff. A unit of the NSG was dispatched to Pathankot on the same day.
According to Air Marshal Khosla After the advance warning was issued all airfields were put on alert especially the Pathankot area because there was a specific input that this is the area where it is likely that something could happen.
Security forces continued search and combing operation inside the Pathankot airbase on Tuesday the fourth day after the attack on the frontline Air Force Station AFS by terrorists. 
The operation was stepped up on Tuesday an Air Force official told IANS. Firing could be heard from inside during Monday night and early Tuesday. 
A military official said a fifth terrorist was killed on the third day of the siege and at least one attacker remained in the complex as troops worked to secure the sprawling compound.

Belgian police have taken three individuals into custody who are connected to a vehicle seen near one of the attack sites.
PARIS French authorities said Saturday that three terrorist teams carried out the highly coordinated attacks on the streets of Paris that left people dead including at least one American and more than people injured.
The French newspaper Le Monde and CNN identified one of the suicide bombers in the attacks as Ismael Omar Mostefai. CNN attributed the identification to aFrench member of Parliament. Mostefai lived in the French city of Chartres at least until said JeanPierre Gorges who is mayor of the cityas well as a member of Parliament CNN reported.
The investigation has also yielded the identity of a French radical among the killers one person with a Syrian passport and a tip that led Belgian authorities to arrest three people linked to the massacres. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said severalterrorists wearingidentical suicide vests died during the attacks late Friday including onekilled by French police and two who detonated theirvest as security forces closed in.
We can say at this stage of the investigation there were probably three coordinated teams of terrorists behind this barbaric act he said at a news conference late Saturday.
Molins raised the death toll to including killed after terrorists stormed the Bataclan concert hall. Another people were injured including who remained in critical condition he added.
Nohemi Gonzalez a college student from California was among the dead according to California State University in Long Beach where she went to school.
Earlier Mark Toner a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department confirmed some Americans were also among the injured but would not elaborate. The United States Embassy in Paris is working around the clock to assist American citizens affected by this tragedy Toner said in a statement.
Another American woman identified as Helen Jane Wilson formerly of New Orleans was undergoing surgery late Saturday at a Paris hospital after being wounded in the leg at the Bataclan the Associated Press reported.
Shortly after a gunman armed with an automatic riflestepped out of a black car and opened fire in Pariss th arrondissement killing people. Molins said cartridges were found at the site.
A third attack occurred at a bar in the adjoining th arrondissement where five people were killed and injured. Individuals also opened fire from a black vehicle at yet another restaurant killing people sitting on a terrace.
Most of the victims were found at the Bataclan concert hall where a performance by the California rock band Eagles of Death Metal was underway. Molins said the terrorists who had parked their car in front burst into the room shot into the air . and took hostages in front of the band. He said people were killed before French police stormed the building.
Police killed one of the gunman while the other two detonated their suicide vests.
Molins said authorities had identified one of the terrorists as a yearold Frenchman known to security forces as having been radicalized. The terrorist from the town of Courcouronnes miles south of Paris was identified through fingerprints.
We have to find who these people are who their accomplices are who ordered this where they come from how they were financed he said.
Meanwhile a tip from witnesses who spotted the terrorists car with Belgian plates at the theaterled Belgian authorities Saturday to arrest three men.Molins said the car had been rented to a Frenchman living in Belgium who was identified in a spot check by police as he drove across the Belgian border with two others.
The French newspaper Liberation quoting a spokesperson for the Greek government also reported that a Syrian passport belonging to a migrant who passed through Greece was found on the body of a suicide bomber.Greek deputy public order minister Nikos Toskas confirmed in a statement that the document passed through Greece on Oct. . It was not immediately clear if the name on the passport was that of the dead terrorist.
A yearold man arrested last week after firearms explosives and hand grenades were found in his car near the border between Germany and Austria had also been linked to the Paris attacks Ludwig Waldinger a spokesman for Bavarian state police told the AP. He has refused to say what he planned to do or where the weapons came from Waldinger said.
French President Francois Hollande called the murderous spree an act of war by the Islamic State also known as ISIL ISIS and its Arabic name Daesh.
France will be pitiless concerning the barbarity of Daesh he said. Hollande declared a state of emergency and ordered extra troops to guard buildings and schools.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve authorized local authorities to impose curfews if needed and said in a televised address Saturday that authorities are banning all public demonstrations until Thursday.
Paris streets were largely empty Saturday with theaters cafes and some Metro stations closed. Major tourist sites like the Eiffel Tower were closed indefinitely. At least a dozen scheduled concerts including a performance by the Irish rock group U were canceled in the capital.
The Islamic State claimed responsibility calling the attacks a blessed battle of revenge for France participation in a U.S.led coalition against militant targets in Syria and Iraq. Its propaganda arm released statements in Arabic French and English that praised the killings according to the SITE Intelligence Group a U.S.based organization that monitors jihadist activity online.
Allah granted victory upon their hands and cast terror into the hearts of the crusaders in their very own homeland the statement said. The Islamic State said eight brothers were armed with assault rifles and wore explosives belts that they detonated when they ran out of ammunition.
The terrorist group also said the targets around Paris were precisely chosen describing the rock concert as hundreds of pagans gathered for a concert of prostitution and vice.
Syrian President Bashar Assad said Saturday that the policies of some Western countries including France in the Middle East were partly responsible for the expansion of terrorism. He urged Hollande to change his policies and work for the interest of the French people.
Assad said his country warned three years ago what would happen in Europe if the West continued to support terrorists in Syria. Assad describes all armed factions in Syria as terrorists including rebel groups fighting his government.
The bloodiest day for France since World War II came just months after people were killed in terror attacks on the Paris offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery store. A police officer was also shot dead by a militant between those attacks.

Beant Singh CriticalPoint gurdaspur terror attack India International Border Khalistan Pakistan Parkash Singh Badal Punjab Punjab CM 
On a clear day the dome of Gurdwara Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur is visible from the rooftop of Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahab in Pakistan. It would be naturally tempting for Pakistan to eye Gurdaspur as a soft target.
Geographically Gurdaspur is vulnerable to infiltration. On paper anybody willing to enter the town from Pakistan would just have to navigate the Ravi and cross into adjoining Dinanagar the third largest municipality of Gurdaspur and erstwhile summer capital of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. This is the route terrorists currently holed up inside a police station in Dinanagar seem to have taken.
Intelligence sources claim a team of terrorists left Narowal a small town in Pakistan just a few kilometres from Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahab on July to strike in India. Just before dawn on Monday July a group of four to five of them hijacked a white Maruti car at gunpoint near Dinanagar fired at people at a bus stand and stormed a police station killing at least nine persons including a Superintendant of Police. They threw bombs on a railway track and fired at a bus. The casualties could have been more if they had not missed a train by just five minutes or the bus driver had not sped away.
If the terrorists entered India through Punjab it is an alarming development. The nearly km international border in Punjab is virtually impregnable because of barbed fence and floodlights. Since when the fencing was completed by India there has been not a single major incident of crossborder terrorism in Punjab.
The closest the terrorists had come to Punjab before this was in when a Hizbul Mujahidin terrorist was held at Chakki Bank railway station in Pathankot. The same year a letter was sent by the LeT to the station superintendant of Pathankot warned of attacks on the Punjab CM and his deputy.
So it is important to know how the border was breached. Did the terrorists dig a tunnel smugglers are known to do this and get inside India Or did they get unchecked into Punjab through Jammu and Kashmir via the Lakhanpur border just a few kilometres north of Gurdaspur Both scenarios indicate serious breach of security and barriers.
Dinanagar is on NH that connects Pathankot in the north and Samakhiali in Gujarat. If terrorists from Pakistan have found a way to get into Dinanagar the entire km highway is vulnerable to future attacks. So the first challenge for India would be to ensure that the border is sealed.
The other worrying development is that terrorists now have their eyes on Punjab they are trying to open a second front after JK. The north Indian state has been quiet for almost two decades. The Gurdaspur incident will revive memories of the states struggle with terrorism in the s.
Separatists lie dormant under the calm surface. For the past few years there have been muted efforts to revive the legacy of Janrail Singh Bhindranwale and the Khalistan movement says Chandigarhbased journalist Sandeep Sinha who tracks terrorismrelated developments closely.
Some years ago when Punjab was shut down in support of Balwant Singh Rajoana who has been sentenced to death for his role in the assassination of former chief minister Beant Singh separatists had surfaced in various parts of the state. In many towns and cities Bhindranwales posters and Khalistan flags had appeared overnight to remind people of the states troubled past.
Just a day before the Gurdaspur attack proKhalistan slogans were raised by two hardliners at a Punjabi University function in Patiala where CM Parkash Singh Badal was the chief guest.
Some forces are hell bent on disrupting the hard earned peace in the state. Punjab has suffered a lot due to such conspiracies in the past. But now the government is keeping a strict vigil to foil the nefarious designs of all those people who were vary to the peace and progress of the state Badal said after the incident.
It is difficult to look for good news in a terror incident. The fact that the terrorists were not allowed to cause too much damage is comforting. The Punjab police have had a history of combating terrorists. Incidentally the current Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini rose to prominence during the days of militancy. He was once a blueeyed boy of KPS Gill. The experience may have been useful in countering the strike.
At the moment the Dinanagar strike appears to be the handiwork of fidayeen attackers from across the border. The modus operandi points to a conspiracy hatched in Pakistan to ensure the two neighbours do not talk peace.
But the Indian government would be relieved only if it finds out that the Gurdaspur attack didnt have a local connection or that it was not supported by local handlers.

Authorities say five Jordanian intelligence agents were killed in a terrorist attack on their office in a Palestinian refugee camp north of the capital Amman.
Jordan is a leading member of the USled coalition fighting the Islamic State group in neighbouring Iraq and Syria and has been the target of jihadist attacks in the past.
In March Jordanian authorities announced they had foiled an IS plot to carry out attacks in the kingdom in an operation that led to the deaths of seven jihadists.
Mr Momani said security forces were investigating who was responsible for the attack on the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
A security source told AFP that preliminary findings suggested the attack was carried out by a lone gunman who opened fire with an automatic weapon before escaping.
The source said it was unclear whether the gunman was a camp resident or an outsider.
In December suicide attacks on three Amman hotels claimed by ISs predecessor Al Qaeda in Iraq killed people and wounded dozens.
The Baqaa camp where Mondays attack took place is kilometres from the centre of Amman and the largest of the kingdoms official Palestinian refugee camps.
It hosts around of Jordans million Palestinian refugees most of whom fled from the West Bank and Gaza Strip after Israels capture of the territorys during the SixDay War of .
In three Jordanian Islamist extremists were sentenced to prison terms of between three years and life for plotting to kill intelligence officers in the camp a court official said at the time.
According to sources close to Islamists almost Jordanians have joined jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria where an estimated have been killed since .

In the wake of the terrorist attack on the offices of French satirist paper Charlie Hebdo one Muslim cleric justified the murders under Islamic law.
French citizens gather in Paris to denounce the terrorist attack against magazine Charlie Hebdo and to rally in defense of free speech. AP
Muslims consider the honor of the Prophet Muhammad to be dearer to them than that of their parents or even themselves. To defend it is considered to be an obligation upon them. The strict punishment if found guilty of this crime under sharia Islamic law is capital punishment implementable by an Islamic State. This is because the Messenger Muhammad said Whoever insults a Prophet kill him.
However because the honor of the Prophet is something which all Muslims want to defend many will take the law into their own hands as we often see.
The contention that mass murder is in any way an appropriate response to being personally offended is a dangerous slope on which to tread. There is no doubt that some of these cartoons can be seen as offensive to certain people but that same sentiment can be asserted on nearly any form of speech especially in politics. Hence the reasoning behind and the sanctity of the Constitutions first amendment.
So why in this case did the French government allow the magazineCharlie Hebdoto continue to provoke Muslims thereby placing the sanctity of its citizens at risk
This kind of blame shifting is also intellectually perilous. Placing the onus of speech on the any secular government is asking for abuse. But if Choudary had his way the government of the Islamic State would tightly control speech and punish transgressions with death.
Choudarys entire argument excusing the Paris attack reveals the fundamental disconnect between views of civilizations. Radical Islamists have no intention of assimilating into their respective cultures or contributing to any kind of meaningful dialogue about religion and free speech. They are intent on terrorizing western citizens out of exerting their rights. Their plan of terrorism and intimidation with the ultimate goal of imposing their religion on others is fundamentally antiAmerican and is not meant for the st century.

Since he and all of us has the right to hate we must remove the awful temptation to turn that hate into violent action. Without a gun hes just a homophobic asshole. With one he is a homicidal maniac. No one should be allowed to burn it all down.

Three people were murdered and dozens wounded in five terror attacks in Jerusalem Raanana and Kiryat Ata on Tuesday. One of the victims was idenified as Rabbi Yeshayahu Krishevsky and another as Haviv Haim .
Hamas praised the attacks saying they are a message to anyone who harms our holy places. We call to continue the intifada which is the natural response to the worlds silence.
In Kiryat Ata a northern city near Haifa a terrorist stabbed at least one person outside IKEA. The attacker has been subdued while the victims was moderately wounded. Both stabber and victim are Jewish but it remains unclear whether the stabbing was a nationalistic incident or a criminal one. Police were investigating the suspicion that the attacker wanted to stab an Arab but mistook the nationality of his victim. 
Three were murdered and others wounded in two simultaneous morning attacks in Jerusalems East Talpiot and Geula neighborhoods.
Two terrorists Baha Aliyan and Bilal Ranem both from Jabel Mukaber boarded an Egged bus on Olei HaGardom Street in East Talpiot a neighborhood also known as Armon HaNetziv one armed with a gun and the other with a knife. 
They started shooting and stabbing passengers while the bus kept moving killing a man in his s and wounding others. One of the wounded a man in his s was evacuated in critical condition and was declared dead at the hospital. 
A security guard at the scene was able to overpower one of the terrorists and shoot him. The attacker then tried to get up and resume his attack but the security guard shot him again. 
The second terrorist locked the bus doors in an attempt to stop security forces from boarding as well as stopping passengers from fleeing. Policemen opened fire at him from outside the bus. 
Eyewitnesses said one of the terrorists took over the drivers seat in an attempt to kidnap the bus. Golan CohenGabai one of the eyewitnesses said he used his car to block off the bus and stop the terrorist from taking it. 
Then he opened the doors and wanted to come at me with a knife. I closed the windows so he ran back and returned with a gun.. I held him here for two minutes and then police forces arrived he said.
Rubi Mahatbi was lightly wounded in the attack. I took bus to the city center. The two terrorists sat there and didnt look suspicion to me but as soon as the bus started moving the terrorist drew out a gun yelled Allahu Akbar and shot a person as he came in my direction. I hid near the door and tried to escape. He drew a knife and started stabbing a military man. The second terrorist grabbed me and tried to attack me but I hit him and was able to escape he said.
That moment you feel fear and stress and you dont know what to do. I preferred running away rather than confronting him. I have bruises on my neck from his attempts to choke me. At that moment all I was thinking about was I was either going to survive this or I die he added. 
An MDA paramedic who arrived at the scene of the attack described it as chaotic saying gunfire was heard as rescue teams arrived. 
On Malkhei Yisrael Street in Geula a terrorist drove a car into a bus stop hitting three pedestrians one of whom yearold Rabbi Yeshayahu Krishevsky was killed. The terrorist then left the vehicle and started repeatedly stabbing his victims. 
A security guard who was nearby arrived at the scene of the attack and shot the terrorist. The terrorist fell down but got back up again leading the security guard to fire at him again. The terrorist then lunged at the security guard and was shot a third time. Border Police forces who arrived at the scene heared calls of bomb and saw the terrorist moving firing at him again. The terrorist was then taken to hospital in serious condition. 
Moshe Shmueli was lightly wounded in the attack. We can see whats happening in the country. Its an act from heaven that comes to awaken the people of Israel he said. 
I wanted to take bus and was waiting at the bus stop when all of a sudden a vehicle appeared and rammed into the bus stop with great force Shmueli recounted. I was sitting inside the bus stop while outside was an older man. It couldve been a lot worse. I was near the terrorist who got out of the car a giant man with hatred and started hitting me and I immediately realized it wasnt an accident but a terror attack. I left everything and ran. All of a sudden I heard gunfire and people telling me to run. I went into a house and the good people there treated me.
We have to stop this entire situation Shmueli added. We cant put a policeman to protect each civilian only the Torah can protect us. 
The terrorist identified as Alaa Abu Jamal a resident of Jabel Mukaber in East Jerusalem who has Israeli citizenship was an employee of Israeli phone company Bezeq and used a company car to commit the attack.
Bezeq and all of its employees scorns this heinous crime. Our hearts are with the victims and their families. 
Abu Jamal is related to the two terrorists who committed the terrorist attack at the Har Nof synagoguein
The wounded from both Jerusalem attacks were taken to Shaare Zedek Medical Center and to the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalems Ein Karem.
Hadassah Ein Karem received five wounded two of whom were the terrorists. One of the terrorists was declared dead while the other was in serious condition. The other three wounded were the Jewish victims one was critically wounded one seriously wounded and one lighttomoderately wounded. 
Four people were wounded in a stabbing attack at a bus stop outside the Beit Loewenstein Rehabilitation Center on Jerusalem Street in Raanana. 
After stabbing his victims the terrorist an East Jerusalem resident in his late s fled towards Ahuza Street a major thoroughfare in the Sharon plains city. He was pursued by civilians. A driver passing by noticed the ongoing chase and hit the terrorist with his car. A taxi driver who was at the scene helped subdue the attacker. 
Large police forces who arrived at the scene arrested the assailant who was employed at the nearby Beit Loewenstein. He was taken to hospital in serious condition.
We saw the terrorist stabbing a helpless older man who was standing at the bus stop. We immediately knew it was a terror attack recounted two people working in one of the businesses in the commercial center where the attack occurred. 
We immediately started calling out Terrorist Terrorist He dropped his knife and started running towards the nearby Ahuza Street. We chased him and then he drew another knife a smaller one and kept trying to stab us they continued.
We called out to drivers to help us and then they hindered his escape and we managed to catch him on Ahuza Street along with other people. He received quite a beating. Only after he was neutralized he let go of the knife and then the police came and arrested him they said.
At least one person was seriously wounded suffering stab wounds to his upper body including his neck while the others were lightlytomoderately hurt. The wounded were taken to the Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba and the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikvah.
Earlier one Israeli was lightly wounded in a stabbing attack in Raanana while waiting for the bus not far from the city hall on Ahuza Street.
The attacker a resident of East Jerusalem attempted to stab him. He fought off his assailant and was hurt in the struggle. Other civilians came to his aid and helped him overpower the terrorist who was lightly wounded.
Maden David Adom paramedics evacuated the wounded Israeli to the Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba with stab wounds to his upper body.
Raanana mayor Zeev Bielski who spoke to the victim Yair Ben Ezra said Ben Ezra told him he suspected the stabber. 
He said I saw there was something about him and that is why the stab wounds were likely not where the stabber wanted and he fought him and managed to come out in reasonable condition Bielski told Ynet. 
Large police forces from the Sharon plains district arrived at the scene following the attack.
Following the attacks Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely slammed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas holding him responsible for the attack.
Mahmoud Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh has praised and glorified a yearold Palestinian who set out with a butchers knife to murder Israeli children in a candy shop she said.
The blood of Israeli citizens is on the hands of Mahmoud Abbas and his colleagues who are inciting children to commit murder. The Palestinian Authority instead of preventing violence has become an incubator for fanatical terrorism which is striking daily at Israeli citizens.
Hotovely called on Israels government to consider halting money transfers to the Palestinian Authority.
The Foreign Ministry urges donor countries to use their influence to effect a cessation in violence and incitement by the Palestinian Authority she added. 
Overnight Monday IDF and Judea and Samaria police forces arrested wanted Palestinians in the West Bank who are suspected of involvement in terror activity and violent rioting against civilians and security forces. 
The arrested Palestinians some of whom are suspected of stonethrowing were taken into questioning. 
Tuesdays attacks are the latest incident in a monthlong wave of attacks the worst spell of street violence for years stirred in part by Muslim anger over increasing Jewish visits to the alAqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem. 
Since Rosh HaShana last month seven Israelis have been killed and dozens wounded in shooting and stoning attacks and a series of stabbings. 
At least Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire including attackers and the rest in clashes between stonethrowers and Israeli troops. Hundreds of Palestinians have been wounded in such confrontations. 
On Monday Palestinians carried out three stabbings in Jerusalem leaving a teenage Israeli boy in critical condition. 
The daily knife attacks have stoked concern of a new Palestinian uprising and though Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have appealed for calm the violence shows no signs of abating. 
Palestinian groups declared a Day of Rage on Tuesday across the West Bank Gaza and East Jerusalem. The leaders of Israels Arab community have called for a commercial strike in their towns and villages.

The dual hostage situations in France have ended and three terror suspects were killed Friday.
The hunt for suspects followed an attack Wednesday on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that left dead.
Police mounted attacks on two hostagestandoffs about miles apart on Friday. They killed two terror suspects Cherif Kouachi and his older brother Said who police say were responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre holed up in a warehouse north of Paris and a gunman who had seized hostages at a kosher supermarket in the capital.
Hayat Boumeddiene is said by police to be the commonlaw wife and accomplice of Amedy Coulibaly the supermarket gunman. Boumeddienes whereabouts remain unknown as does her connection to the attack on the supermarket. 
Hostages were freed at both sites in France including at the supermarket and one from the warehouse. Four hostages at the supermarket are dead according to the French president. 
AlQaedas Yemen branch said it was responsible for the Wednesday attack on Charlie Hebdo saying it was to revengethe honor of Mohammed. U.S. authorities are reviewing the claim and it was not clear whether alQaeda actually directed and financed the attack or merely supported the strike two U.S. officials said.
The JeSuisCharlie hashtag which has been used this week to express support for victims of the attack on Charlie Hebdo is now one of the most popular ever on Twitter.
During the siege north of Paris schools went into lockdown and officials appealed to residents to stay inside their houses.
As in the Boston incident in the suspects in this case were two apparent radicalized brothers who allegedly planned and executed a methodical attack against a specific target that put a major city on high alert. 
A young photographer was named yesterday as the first British victim of the atrocity which saw sunbathing holidaymakers mown down in a hail of bullets with also left wounded.
Carly Lovett from Gainsborough Lincolnshire is believed to have been in the North African country with friends and family since Tuesday reports the Lincolnshire Echo.

The third victim was later named as his nephew yearold local football referee Joel Richards.
Mr Richards who played for James Connollys GFC in Warwickshire was described by friends on social media as ambitious and one of a kind.
Patrick Evans who was Mr Richards Grandfather and Mr Evans father was also killed.
Couple Scott Chalkley of Derby and Sue Davey also of Tamworth Staffordshire also died in the shooting.
Ms Daveys son Conor Fulford had desperately appealed for information on social media before learning of her death.
Married couple Jim and Anne McQuire from Cumbernauld Lanarkshire have also been named among the dead.
Mr McQuire was a volunteer with the Boys Brigade and worked as a marine engineer before retiring.
Yesterday afternoon the Foreign Office said Britons have died in the beach massacre but the toll may well rise.
Tory MP and Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood added that it was the most significant terrorist attack on the British people since the London Underground bombings on July .
Earlier Tunisian officials said Britons a German and a Belgian had been identified among the victims so far.
Irish motheroftwo Lorna Carty is also said to be among the dead along with French nationals.
Norfolk Police today confirmed a member of its support staff was among those injured in the attack.
Tony Callaghan who works as a property officer was with his wife on holiday when they were both injured in the shooting.

Lisa Burbidge who was in her s and from Gateshead Tyne Wear was also killed in the attack.
Foreign Office staff have headed to Tunisia while thousands of British holidaymakers have begun returning from north Africa to UK airports.
Holidays to Sousse were this morning cancelled by major tour operators TUI group which owns Thomson and First Choice and runs the Imperial Marhaba hotel where the shooting took place.
Islamic State social media accounts today claimed they were behind Fridays attack as the militants released photos of yearold student Seifeddine Rezgui who uses the jihadi pseudonym Abu Yahya alQayrawani who they claimed to be the gunman.
Rezgui posed as a tourist before pulling a Kalashnikov hidden in a beach umbrella and firing at people relaxing on a beach in Sousse on the Mediterranean coast.
He was reportedly laughing as he carried out the massacre and deliberately selected British tourists.
He was choosing who to shoot. Some people he was saying to them You go away.
Despite initially believing there was more than one gunman the Tunisian authorities later said the solo killer had not previously been known to their security services.
His killing spree on the beach at the Riu Bellevue Park ended when he was shot dead by police.
Shocking video footage taken by one of the eyewitnesses showed the carnage at the holiday resort in the immediate aftermath.
A clip posted to YouTube showed people at the tourist destination in panic and running away from gun shots which were heard ringing through the air.
The distressing clip also showed dead bodies laying on the beach after the brutal terrorist attack.
A Welshman is in hospital in a serious condition after using his body as a human shield to protect his fiancee from being killed by the gunman.
Gas engineer Matthew James from south Wales was hit in the shoulder chest and hip as he acted as a human shield to save Sarah Wilson.
Among the other harrowing stories coming out of the African state a yearold Brit told how they witnessed their parents and grandmother killed.
A Tunisian radio station reported the teen was being treated for their injuries in hospital.
Lorna Carty was taking her husband on holiday to help him recover from heart surgery family friends have said.
Mrs Carty from Robinstown Co Meath was believed to have gone to the beach by herself in Sousse when the gunman went on the rampage.
Her husband a dairy farmer is said to be uninjured but absolutely distraught.
A family friend said Mr and Mrs Carty were due to leave Tunisia to return to Ireland just hours after the massacre.
Declan was in the hotel and Lorna went out to get a last bit of sun before leaving.
When he heard all the commotion he went out then he recognised the towel and the blood on it.
A British tennis coach who had been on holiday in Tunisia since Wednesday said she saw the gunman attack.
All of a sudden he dropped the umbrella and had a gun and he started shooting everyone to the right of me.
There have been people missing from our resort and others. It could have been a very different story if he had started shooting left instead of right.
Sousse is one of Tunisias most popular beach resorts drawing visitors from Europe and neighbouring North African countries.
A British holidaymaker described hearing a large explosion followed by a chaotic scene with tourists running around the hotel.
This has been contradicted by other hotel workers who described the attacker as wearing tourists clothes.
Another tourist Susan Rickett on holiday in Sousse described how everybody starting running in and screaming after gunfire was heard on the beach.
Fellow Briton Gary Pine said he was on the beach and heard what we thought was firecrackers going off yards away followed by an explosion from the next hotel complex along.
He said there was a mass exodus off the beach and his son said he had seen someone get shot on the beach.
Mr Pine said that guests at his hotel were first told to lock themselves in their rooms and later to gather in the lobby.
Elizabeth OBrien an Irish woman on holiday with her two sons in the resort described how she grabbed her children and ran for their lives when they heard gunfire erupting from one of the hotels.
It was about oclock and I just looked up about metres from me and I saw a hot air balloon collapse down then rapid firing then I saw two of the people who were going to go up in the balloon start to run towards me because I thought it was fireworks.
So I thought oh my God it sounds like gunfire so I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and as I was running towards the hotel the waiters and the security on the beach started saying run run run and we just ran to our room which is like a little bungalow.
The Tunisia terror attack came on the same day as a lone terrorist beheaded a man at a factory in France.
Friday also saw a bloody massacre carried out by Islamic State in Kuwait where explosions were heard at a Shiite mosque after Friday prayers.
It is not known if there is a link between the atrocities although the jihadists have called for more attacks during the Islamic holy month on Ramadan.
Next Tuesday June also marks the first anniversary of Islamic State declaring their caliphate in Syria and Iraq.
The killings at the Sousse resort are the second terrorist attack on tourists in Tunisia this year.
Tunisia has been on high alert since March when the Islamist militant gunmen attacked the Bardo museum in Tunisia killing a group of foreign tourists in one of the worst attacks in a decade in the North African country.
A failed attack also took place at a hotel in the same Sousse resort in October .
Tourists are attracted to its excellent beaches and fascinating cultural attractions including a ninth century mosque and UNESCO World Heritage Site at the medina.
Its Mediterranean climate has led to the creation of hotels providing beds.
Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond insisted that travel advice issued in the wake of the March attack in Tunisia was appropriate as he rejected the suggestion that an opportunity was missed to warn Britons to stay away from Tunisia.
Mr Hammond said that travel advice would be kept under constant review following the latest atrocity and will be considered at the next meeting of the Governments Cobra emergency committee.
Of course an incident like this can occur anywhere. Im confident that the travel advice we set was appropriate but we are now of course reviewing that
Foreign Office sources said the advice given to Britons about travelling to Tunisia was in line with that given by other European countries to their citizens.
The latest advice warns there is a high threat from terrorism including kidnapping.
The Foreign Office has set up a helpline on for those concerned about relatives.
We are getting reports that two female terrorists have been shot dead in Istanbul after they attacked a police bus near a police station.
The pair targeted a riot police bus with a machine gun and launched explosives towards it as it drove into a police station.Police officers then returned fire before tracing them to a government building.Residents in the nearby area were evacuated as specialized police prepared to capture them.
Officers then raided the building and shot the pair dead after they failed to surrender.Two police officers were wounded one by broken glass and the other during the raid on the building.Istanbul Governor Vahip Sahin said police were trying to identify the attackers and any accomplices.
There has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.Dramatic footage has emerged which shows the moment the two women attacked the riot police bus.TheAnadolu news agency reports that the two women have been identified as members of the leftist DHKPC militant group.
In October two suicide bombers left people dead in the capital.Turkey has increasinglybecome a target for ISIS who are blamed for at least three suicide bombings.
Please stay with us as we get more details on this unfolding story and make sure to share the news with everyone you know
WELL LETS SEE American ambassador murdered by obama in Benghazi because he knew obam the imam was running guns to the ISIS group in Syria THROUGH TURKEY Assad wants to control his power
More than people are thought to have died when a suicide bomber struck an amateur gamein Iskandariya roughly miles south of Baghdad.
Im shocked and terribly saddened to have learnt about the awful tragedy which occurred yesterday at a football game in Iskandariya Iraq read a statement from Infantino.
Around the world football unites people. It is a very sad day when people going to a match together become the victims of such violence.
The bombing took place during a match in the small stadium in the city of Iskanderiyah miles kilometers from Baghdad the officials said. Medical officials confirmed the death toll. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.
The U.S. Embassy in Brussels is recommending that Americans in Belgium stay where they are and avoid public transportation.
And in Brussels the city center is often deserted as armed soldiers patrol tourist sites amid repeated government warnings that a terrorist attack is serious and imminent.
Some experts say it will take months for Europeans to psychologically adapt to life after the Paris attacks and warn that certain government measures intended to reassure people may backfire creating instead the impression of cities under siege.
The police barred media from publishing images of Yakub Abdul Razak Memons funeral apparently fearing a backlash against the execution that many said was driven by politics.
Executions are rare in India and in the last decade only two others have taken place both of terror convicts like Memon.
The earlier two executions were conducted in extreme secrecy and announced only after the fact. Their bodies were not handed to their families but were buried inside prison compounds.
French investigators were working to determine the recipients identity but werent able to immediately confirm media reports that it was an unspecified person now in Syria where the radical Islamic State group has seized territory the security officials said.
The revelation added a macabre twist to an investigation that has not turned up a solid link to radical or foreign groups but has revived concerns about terrorism in France less than six months after deadly attacks in the Paris area.
Tourists crowded into the airport at Hammamet near the coastal city of Sousse where a young man dressed in shorts on Friday pulled an assault rifle out of his beach umbrella and killed people mostly tourists.
The fight against terrorism is a national responsibility said a visibly exhausted Habib Essid at a press conference in Tunis early Saturday. We are at war against terrorism which represents a serious danger to national unity during this delicate period that the nation is going through.
The embassy released a statement Friday night urging Americans to report suspicious activities and stay away from any security incidents.
It also noted that French authorities have increased the terrorism alert level in recent months since attacks in January in Paris left victims and three Islamic attackers dead so there are more troops and police in the streets than in previous years.
And French prosecutors say the suspect who they believe attacked a U.S. gas plant in France is a local truck driver who was known to workers at the Air Products plant.
A pair of gunmen killed at least people on a Tunisian beach Friday in the latest attack on the north African countrys key tourism industry the Interior Ministry said.
The governor of the Styria province Hermann Schuetzenhoefer gave the casualty figures and described the suspected driver as a yearold Austrian who was mentally disoriented and acting alone.
Police said the driver had been arrested. They said there were no indications of a terrorist attack and the suspect was apparently distressed over personal problems when he targeted his victims.
More than .m supporters including tens of thousands of British and Irish fans are expected to attend the continents flagship football event making the tournament a huge potential target for the Islamic terrorists.
Mohamed Abrini who was arrested following the bloody Belgian attacks earlier this month has now told police about the planned attack although prosecutors are refusing to reveal details.
Its extra proof of the very high threats to the whole of Europe and to France in particular 
Abrini a BelgianMoroccan national was one of six people arrested last week in connection with the Brussels attacks which left dead. He was also wanted in connection with the Paris attacks last November.
His fingerprints were found in two safe houses in Belgian linked to the terrorists and his warning is sure to worry authorities across Europe.
Abrinis open threat to the tournament will bring back chilling memories of last Novembers deadly attacks in Paris in which people were killed in a series of explosions and shootings including one at the Stade de France which is due to hold this summers highprofile final.
One innocent civilian was killed when three suicide bombers blew themselves up near the stadium on November while a friendly match was being played between France and Germany
The televised footage of footballers and fans responding with confusion to the sound of explosions chilled viewers and will be in the minds of organisers as they seek to protect fans this summer.
Ireland manager Martin ONeill has already admitted that proposals to play the tournament without any fans present may be necessary for the safety of the people.
Theres talk about matches being played behind closed doors but the safety of people is of paramount importance and anything that is agreed upon we will fall in line.
With the tournament now just two months away UEFA the European footballing body has not ruled out banning fans from matches altogether although currently they are focusing on more security checks around stadiums and a heavy police presence.
Four nuns of the Missionaries of Charity the order founded by Blessed Mother Teresa were among people killed by gunmen who stormed an senior carehome in the Yemeni port city of Aden on Friday officials and witnesses said.

Adens Christian churches have also come under attack. During the summer a Catholic church in the district of Crater was torched and sabotaged by Islamic extremists.
Four Missionary Sisters of Charity the community founded by Mother Teresa of Calcutta were shot dead by gunmen in a raid on their convent early this morning in the Yemenite city of Aden. The news was confirmed to Fides by sources at the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia. Besides the Sisters the driver and at least two other Ethiopian community helpers were killed. The Convent Superior and old people or disabled persons living at the community were unharmed. However so far there is no news of Indian Salesian priest Fr Tom Uzhunnalil who has been staying at the sisters house since the Holy Family church in a Aden was sacked and torched by unidentified gunmen last September.Two of the sisters killed were Rwandan one was Indian and the fourth was from Kenya. At the moment the convent Superior is giving information to the local police who are keeping the bodies of the poor sisters and the other victims in custody.
So far no one has claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack but it is known that in this Yemenite portcity retaken some months ago by troops faithful to president Abdel Rabbo Mansour Hadi in conflict with Houthi rebels there are deeply rooted bands in connection with the network of al Qaida.
Adapted from a report by Alliance worker Bonnie Oberg who serves in Burkina Faso West Africa
Many of you have read about the terrorist attack in our city Ouagadougou which targeted a popular downtown restaurant and hotel Friday night leaving dead and wounded.
My husband Kevin and I were in another neighborhood that night but we often have eaten at the restaurant where the attack took place. Several years ago our Alliance mission held a Field Forum annual conference in that hotel.
Saturday evening we learned that a ministry partner Mike Riddering was killed during the attack. He and his wife Amy have served in Burkina with Sheltering Wings running an orphanage and womens crisis center in Yako about miles north of Ougadougou.
Our Ouaga Envision team membershave beengood friends with the Ridderings and often brought shortterm teams to their orphanage for ministry. We have taken teams there as well.
On the same day as the attacks in the city an Australian couple who have served faithfully for decades in Burkina was abducted by extremists. Please pray that God will protect Ken and Jocelyn Elliot and that they will be released soon.
Will I pray for my enemies pleading that God will open eyes and save souls Or will I harden my heart and not care that they are lost for eternity
Maybe this is what loving your enemies means.We dont have to like them we can abhor what they do.But does my heart ache when I think about whattheyare facing for eternity completely lost and separated from God forever
It is not a matter of desiring justice. Justice will come if not in this life then in the next. This is not my personal battlemy sovereign God has that one covered.
My battle is internal. How will I respond based on what Jesus has said Am I willing to go down that path where Christ calls us to go In our human strength this is impossible. With Gods grace and relying on Him to help us it is possible. He makes all the difference.
We thank all who have been praying. We have felt those prayers and seen the answers as we have walked through these difficult days. We have a peace that is unexplainableGod is carrying us.
We may never understand why evil seems to have the upper hand at times but we do know in those times that God is there and God is good. He understands the whys that we dont and that is enough.
While no Alliance workers were injured one worker from another partner organization lost his life in the attack. Please pray for his wife and several young children as they process this loss. Pray for Alliance workers as they reach out to this family. Also a couple working with another missions organization in northern Burkina was taken hostage. Please pray for their rescue and protection.
Alliance worker Alice Brokopp writes Pray for the families of all those killed and wounded in the attack . . . for forgiveness love not a reaction in bitterness .. . Pray that God will somehow use these events to advance His Kingdom.May this and other attacks not be in vain and as they spread may His love and hope be shown through His people.May our reaction not be one of FEAR but of LOVE.
We cannot Live the Call Together unless prayer is central to all we do.Pray with us 
Is God calling you to service Were here to help you connect your passion with Gods purpose.Serve with The Alliance

Momani said three noncommissioned officers from the guard office a receptionist and a handyman were killed by the assailants.
He said that the crime happened on the first day of the holy month of Ramadan which indicated that the perpetrators who are suspected to be Islamists acted outside of our religion.
The killings on Monday morning were described as a terrorist attack by the Jordanian media but no details were immediately provided.
Jordan has been relatively safe from terrorist attacks despite bordering Iraq and Syria two major sources of instability in the Middle East. The last large successful attacks in the country happened in when AlQaeda bombed three hotel lobbies in Amman killing people.
Jordan currently hosts an estimated million Palestinian refugees most of whom live in refugee camps throughout the country.

More than .m supporters including tens of thousands of British and Irish fans are expected to attend the continents flagship football event making the tournament a huge potential target for the Islamic terrorists.
Mohamed Abrini who was arrested following the bloody Belgian attacks earlier this month has now told police about the planned attack although prosecutors are refusing to reveal details.
Its extra proof of the very high threats to the whole of Europe and to France in particular 
Abrini a BelgianMoroccan national was one of six people arrested last week in connection with the Brussels attacks which left dead. He was also wanted in connection with the Paris attacks last November.
His fingerprints were found in two safe houses in Belgian linked to the terrorists and his warning is sure to worry authorities across Europe.
Abrinis open threat to the tournament will bring back chilling memories of last Novembers deadly attacks in Paris in which people were killed in a series of explosions and shootings including one at the Stade de France which is due to hold this summers highprofile final.
One innocent civilian was killed when three suicide bombers blew themselves up near the stadium on November while a friendly match was being played between France and Germany
The televised footage of footballers and fans responding with confusion to the sound of explosions chilled viewers and will be in the minds of organisers as they seek to protect fans this summer.
Ireland manager Martin ONeill has already admitted that proposals to play the tournament without any fans present may be necessary for the safety of the people.
Theres talk about matches being played behind closed doors but the safety of people is of paramount importance and anything that is agreed upon we will fall in line.
With the tournament now just two months away UEFA the European footballing body has not ruled out banning fans from matches altogether although currently they are focusing on more security checks around stadiums and a heavy police presence.

Concerns about voter support for the far right in France have taken center stage but should not deflect from the underlying problem of homegrown subur.
On the evening of November a series of coordinated terrorists attacks occurred here in Paris. Before this attacks occurred in Beirut Turk.
One cant dispute Republicans concerns about terrorisms threat to national security concerns which Democrats fully share but one can argue how best to proceed and impugning Muslim refugees again plays into Islamic terrorisms hand.
As the terrorist attack in Paris sparks worldwide fear of similar reprisals and a bloody shootout and hostage situation in a fivestar Mali hotel exacerbates those concerns global energy security reels under the pressure of unfathomable geopolitics.
Part of our trip to Paris will be somber but I hope it will expand my knowledge and experience the main reason I travel in the first place.
Think of those first Pilgrims as you plan and prep your own Thanksgiving feast but dont forget the pilgrims among us now. Some traditions no longer serve us. We can rejoice without fowl.
The aftermath of Paris seems likely to be intensified bombing raids in Syria closed borders heightened fearbased security and the deletion of the gray zones of coexistence across the planet.
Emma Lazarus whos proud and shinning words stand indelibly inscribed on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty would weep in sorrow and shame if she were with us today as an ever increasing number of our political leaders and citizens call for the United States to extinguish the flame of liberty on Middle Eastern refugees of war.
Recent terrorist attacks on Paris are a call to action especially for American citizens says pro wrestlings Bill Goldberg. Its not if its when.
Eagles of Death Metal the American bluesrock band that was performing at Paris Le Bataclan when terrorists attacked Friday night said its members .
The most difficult thing that is left to be done after this massacre is to understand what is happening to us to conceptualize the hate that is enveloping us to conceptualize the profound threats looming over our democracies.
Just the fact that the terrorist attack took place in Paris an international city we connect with beauty love and pleasure is an assault on humanit.
Dont hole up in your apartment and cry forever. Get up and take a walk. You can go jogging go to the gym or even go swimming. Exercise doesnt just make you physically fit it also improves your mental state.
We must not send those fleeing persecution back to their persecutors. The definition of moral courage is to resist allowing fear to overwhelm our humanity.
It is not an exaggeration to say that Paris is in my heart every single moment of every day. And as my readers have shown me the extraordinary city of Paris is in their hearts as well.
The race to increase security is in full swing. Posing realistic applicable or useful measures doesnt seem to be taking first priority instead theres talking for talkings sake and the publishing of words that seem to echo the fears of the French.
Postponing a major conference to a later date when its main objective is to reduce the dependence on oil and gas and therefore indirectly weaken the ISIS economy would be unwise.
We are not part of them but unfortunately these brutes are part of us. They are part of society. Our society. They dont come from Mars. They have been among us. Always. It is our problem and we as a society are responsible for solving this problem.

The suspect had reportedly been in touch with illegal militias in Ukraine with the aim of building a huge arsenal to use in his oneman terror rampage.
Three people were murdered and dozens wounded in five terror attacks in Jerusalem Raanana and Kiryat Ata on Tuesday. One of the victims was idenified as Rabbi Yeshayahu Krishevsky and another as Haviv Haim .
Hamas praised the attacks saying they are a message to anyone who harms our holy places. We call to continue the intifada which is the natural response to the worlds silence.
In Kiryat Ata a northern city near Haifa a terrorist stabbed at least one person outside IKEA. The attacker has been subdued while the victims was moderately wounded. Both stabber and victim are Jewish but it remains unclear whether the stabbing was a nationalistic incident or a criminal one. Police were investigating the suspicion that the attacker wanted to stab an Arab but mistook the nationality of his victim. 
Three were murdered and others wounded in two simultaneous morning attacks in Jerusalems East Talpiot and Geula neighborhoods.
Two terrorists Baha Aliyan and Bilal Ranem both from Jabel Mukaber boarded an Egged bus on Olei HaGardom Street in East Talpiot a neighborhood also known as Armon HaNetziv one armed with a gun and the other with a knife. 
They started shooting and stabbing passengers while the bus kept moving killing a man in his s and wounding others. One of the wounded a man in his s was evacuated in critical condition and was declared dead at the hospital. 
A security guard at the scene was able to overpower one of the terrorists and shoot him. The attacker then tried to get up and resume his attack but the security guard shot him again. 
The second terrorist locked the bus doors in an attempt to stop security forces from boarding as well as stopping passengers from fleeing. Policemen opened fire at him from outside the bus. 
Eyewitnesses said one of the terrorists took over the drivers seat in an attempt to kidnap the bus. Golan CohenGabai one of the eyewitnesses said he used his car to block off the bus and stop the terrorist from taking it. 
Then he opened the doors and wanted to come at me with a knife. I closed the windows so he ran back and returned with a gun.. I held him here for two minutes and then police forces arrived he said.
Rubi Mahatbi was lightly wounded in the attack. I took bus to the city center. The two terrorists sat there and didnt look suspicion to me but as soon as the bus started moving the terrorist drew out a gun yelled Allahu Akbar and shot a person as he came in my direction. I hid near the door and tried to escape. He drew a knife and started stabbing a military man. The second terrorist grabbed me and tried to attack me but I hit him and was able to escape he said.
That moment you feel fear and stress and you dont know what to do. I preferred running away rather than confronting him. I have bruises on my neck from his attempts to choke me. At that moment all I was thinking about was I was either going to survive this or I die he added. 
An MDA paramedic who arrived at the scene of the attack described it as chaotic saying gunfire was heard as rescue teams arrived. 
On Malkhei Yisrael Street in Geula a terrorist drove a car into a bus stop hitting three pedestrians one of whom yearold Rabbi Yeshayahu Krishevsky was killed. The terrorist then left the vehicle and started repeatedly stabbing his victims. 
A security guard who was nearby arrived at the scene of the attack and shot the terrorist. The terrorist fell down but got back up again leading the security guard to fire at him again. The terrorist then lunged at the security guard and was shot a third time. Border Police forces who arrived at the scene heared calls of bomb and saw the terrorist moving firing at him again. The terrorist was then taken to hospital in serious condition. 
Moshe Shmueli was lightly wounded in the attack. We can see whats happening in the country. Its an act from heaven that comes to awaken the people of Israel he said. 
I wanted to take bus and was waiting at the bus stop when all of a sudden a vehicle appeared and rammed into the bus stop with great force Shmueli recounted. I was sitting inside the bus stop while outside was an older man. It couldve been a lot worse. I was near the terrorist who got out of the car a giant man with hatred and started hitting me and I immediately realized it wasnt an accident but a terror attack. I left everything and ran. All of a sudden I heard gunfire and people telling me to run. I went into a house and the good people there treated me.
We have to stop this entire situation Shmueli added. We cant put a policeman to protect each civilian only the Torah can protect us. 
The terrorist identified as Alaa Abu Jamal a resident of Jabel Mukaber in East Jerusalem who has Israeli citizenship was an employee of Israeli phone company Bezeq and used a company car to commit the attack.
Bezeq and all of its employees scorns this heinous crime. Our hearts are with the victims and their families. 
Abu Jamal is related to the two terrorists who committed the terrorist attack at the Har Nof synagoguein
The wounded from both Jerusalem attacks were taken to Shaare Zedek Medical Center and to the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalems Ein Karem.
Hadassah Ein Karem received five wounded two of whom were the terrorists. One of the terrorists was declared dead while the other was in serious condition. The other three wounded were the Jewish victims one was critically wounded one seriously wounded and one lighttomoderately wounded. 
Four people were wounded in a stabbing attack at a bus stop outside the Beit Loewenstein Rehabilitation Center on Jerusalem Street in Raanana. 
After stabbing his victims the terrorist an East Jerusalem resident in his late s fled towards Ahuza Street a major thoroughfare in the Sharon plains city. He was pursued by civilians. A driver passing by noticed the ongoing chase and hit the terrorist with his car. A taxi driver who was at the scene helped subdue the attacker. 
Large police forces who arrived at the scene arrested the assailant who was employed at the nearby Beit Loewenstein. He was taken to hospital in serious condition.
We saw the terrorist stabbing a helpless older man who was standing at the bus stop. We immediately knew it was a terror attack recounted two people working in one of the businesses in the commercial center where the attack occurred. 
We immediately started calling out Terrorist Terrorist He dropped his knife and started running towards the nearby Ahuza Street. We chased him and then he drew another knife a smaller one and kept trying to stab us they continued.
We called out to drivers to help us and then they hindered his escape and we managed to catch him on Ahuza Street along with other people. He received quite a beating. Only after he was neutralized he let go of the knife and then the police came and arrested him they said.
At least one person was seriously wounded suffering stab wounds to his upper body including his neck while the others were lightlytomoderately hurt. The wounded were taken to the Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba and the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikvah.
Earlier one Israeli was lightly wounded in a stabbing attack in Raanana while waiting for the bus not far from the city hall on Ahuza Street.
The attacker a resident of East Jerusalem attempted to stab him. He fought off his assailant and was hurt in the struggle. Other civilians came to his aid and helped him overpower the terrorist who was lightly wounded.
Maden David Adom paramedics evacuated the wounded Israeli to the Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba with stab wounds to his upper body.
Raanana mayor Zeev Bielski who spoke to the victim Yair Ben Ezra said Ben Ezra told him he suspected the stabber. 
He said I saw there was something about him and that is why the stab wounds were likely not where the stabber wanted and he fought him and managed to come out in reasonable condition Bielski told Ynet. 
Large police forces from the Sharon plains district arrived at the scene following the attack.
Following the attacks Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely slammed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas holding him responsible for the attack.
Mahmoud Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh has praised and glorified a yearold Palestinian who set out with a butchers knife to murder Israeli children in a candy shop she said.
The blood of Israeli citizens is on the hands of Mahmoud Abbas and his colleagues who are inciting children to commit murder. The Palestinian Authority instead of preventing violence has become an incubator for fanatical terrorism which is striking daily at Israeli citizens.
Hotovely called on Israels government to consider halting money transfers to the Palestinian Authority.
The Foreign Ministry urges donor countries to use their influence to effect a cessation in violence and incitement by the Palestinian Authority she added. 
Overnight Monday IDF and Judea and Samaria police forces arrested wanted Palestinians in the West Bank who are suspected of involvement in terror activity and violent rioting against civilians and security forces. 
The arrested Palestinians some of whom are suspected of stonethrowing were taken into questioning. 
Tuesdays attacks are the latest incident in a monthlong wave of attacks the worst spell of street violence for years stirred in part by Muslim anger over increasing Jewish visits to the alAqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem. 
Since Rosh HaShana last month seven Israelis have been killed and dozens wounded in shooting and stoning attacks and a series of stabbings. 
At least Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire including attackers and the rest in clashes between stonethrowers and Israeli troops. Hundreds of Palestinians have been wounded in such confrontations. 
On Monday Palestinians carried out three stabbings in Jerusalem leaving a teenage Israeli boy in critical condition. 
The daily knife attacks have stoked concern of a new Palestinian uprising and though Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have appealed for calm the violence shows no signs of abating. 
Palestinian groups declared a Day of Rage on Tuesday across the West Bank Gaza and East Jerusalem. The leaders of Israels Arab community have called for a commercial strike in their towns and villages.

The first bombing on an Israeli bus in years appears to be an act of terrorism police said.
The explosion late Monday afternoon took place just days before the Jewish Passover holiday and the security presence in the city was reinforced afterward police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Police are working carefully to rule out that it wasnt a criminal incident he said but the main direction is that it was a terrorist attack.
The device went off at the back of a city bus near the engine blowing up the gas tank and causing the vehicle to go up in flames Rosenfeld said. He said he didnt have details about the device but Israel Radio said it appeared to be an improvised bomb.
One reason police were unable to conclusively determine if the bombing was politically motivated is that the identity of the bomber wasnt known Rosenfeld said. Media speculated it might be an unidentified man hospitalized in a Jerusalem medical center with critically wounds from the explosion.
The blast occurred just a week after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reported a sharp decline in the wave of stabbing shooting and hitandrun attacks that has swept Israel since October. It brought back harsh memories of the wave of bus bombings that killed hundreds of Israelis in the second Palestinian uprising against Israel.
While police were still pursuing their investigation Netanyahu pronounced the explosion a terrorist attack.
We will settle accounts with these terrorists Netanyahu saidlate Monday in remarks sent from his office by text message. We will locate whoever assembled this bomb we will reach the dispatchers and we will get to whoever stands behind them.
Hamas the Palestinian group that rules the Gaza Strip issued a statement praising the bombing without claiming responsibility.
The bombing attack is a natural reaction to the Israeli crimes Hamasspokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said in an emailed statement from Gaza.
Hours earlier the army said it uncovered and destroyed an attack tunnel dug into its territory from Gaza the first found since a war with the Palestinian territorys Hamas rulers. Hamas uses the tunnels to store weapons and cross the border totry to kidnap or kill Israelis.
Earlier on Monday Abu Obeida a spokesman for theAlQassam Brigades Hamas armed wing said the tunnel is a drop in the sea of what Hamas prepares.

MDA spokesman Zaki Heller said that paramedics immediately arrived on scene and treated the five who were injured. All five were in their s and another female officer suffered anxiety.
The attack took place outside a Border Police base in northern Jerusalem on Shimon HaTzadik street which was also the site of a November hit and run terror attack that killed one border police offer and injured people. The area has seen no less than terror attacks in the past year.
After hitting the group of officers who were outside the base the Palestinian continued meters to the light rail station where he hit a bicyclist a yearold Israeli man.

Terrorism hit the Atataturk airport in Istanbul last night as three suicide bombers exploded powerful devices that killed and injured a large number of people. The rising number of victims is currently dead and injured. ISIS is suspected as inspiring or directing the attack.
Cable news repeatedly showed frightening images of massive explosions in a transit lounge as well as a gunman running into the airport shooting a AK assault weapon who then is shot by airport security and drops his weapon only to blow his suicide vest up as he lies on the floor.
This latest attack comes on the heels of previous terrorist attacks in Turkey including two prior attacks in Istanbul this year including a car bomb earlier this month and a suicide bomber earlier this year as well as deadly car bombs in Ankara this year which doubtlessly will have the effect of frightening people from traveling or cruising to Turkey.
A number of newspapers have recently reported that the two terrorists attacks last year in Tunisiawhich killed cruise passengers from Costa and MSC cruise ships at the Bardo Museum in Tunis and later several dozens of British tourists on holiday at beach resorts in Sousse Tunisia is causing the countrys tourism industry to struggle. Skift reports that Tunisian tourist revenue was down percent last year at . billion and caused the dinar currency to historic lows against the dollar and euro this month.
This is bad news for the future of tourism in Turkey. There have been at least eight terror attacks in Turkey dating back a year. USA TODAY today published an article today which notes that the string of attacks have caused a big drop in tourism a major source of revenue for Turkey. Many cruise ships that used to make port calls in Istanbul are bypassing the city.
The CruiseArabia website says that justtwo international cruise ships were in Turkish waters at the time of the attack Tuesday both Wind Star and Royal Caribbeans Jewel of the Seas have continued with their cruise itineraries as planned.
At the time of writing Jewel of the Seas was in port in Kusudasi while Wind Star was anchored off Bodrum. Both Windstar Cruises and Royal Caribbean have refused to comment on whether any additional security has been put in place for passengers on shore excursions in the wake of the attacks.
Theres no question that cruising to Europe seems to be lagging behind cruises to other locations which are perceived to be safer like the Caribbean.We all know from comments by the cruise executives at Royal Caribbean following its last quarter that Americans Are Cruising Closer to U.S. Waters due to the terrorist activities in Paris and Brussels. 
The number one location that we are asked about is Turkey. To respond to such inquiries we mention prior terrorist attacks there and the issue of immigrants from Syria and other countries but the reader has to make up their own mind whether it is reasonably safe based on their own risk assessment.
But its naive to think that cruising to the Caribbean is safer than cruising to Europe. I can readily say that cruising to the Caribbean will take you to some of the most dangerous ports of call in the world not from terrorists mind you but from common criminals. Some of the Caribbean ports have a lot of crime and high murder rates which make cruising to Nassau St. Thomas and Roatan like cruising to East St. Louis Baltimore and Detroit except most U.S. citizens dont know any better. Europe is far safer than the Caribbean in terms of rape murder harassment and theft.
Most experts seems to say its just a matter of when and where not if ISIS will attack. The highly respected gCaptain reported yesterday that Captain William Nault Chief of Staff with the multinational Combined Maritime Forces CMF told Reutersthat Al Qaedas Yemen branch remains a powerful force and poses a growing risk to ships. 
We have seen other dontworryaboutathing articles from travel writers before likethe article in the Telegraph in February Are Cruise Holidays Safe from Terrorism written by U.K. cruise travel specialist Jane Archer who appeared to us to ignore history and downplay the threat of terror.
Chances are remote of course that you will be attacked by terrorists when you cruise in or around Europe. The chances of being a victim of crime in the Caribbean are greater. But as far as cruises in either part of the world you certainly arent nuts if you decide to vacation somewhere else this summer.
Stephen L. Caldwella member of the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee. downplayed the threat of international radical Islamic terrorism on the cruise industry in an article for Maritime Executive entitled Tightening the Security Envelope Despite all the hoopla about terrorist threats and onboard crime cruise ships are among the safest places on earth. He suggests that talk of terrorism is much ado about nothing. I posted Mr.Caldwells articleon our Facebook page with the comment thatif the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security is listening to this committee on international maritime security matters passengers are sitting ducks.
My view is that Mr. Caldwells naive article might as well have been written by the Cruise Line International Association for PR purposes. It is dangerously irresponsible to crew members and cruise passengers alike. I have expressed my feelings here about the threat of ISIS on cruise shipping many times before includingHow the Next Jihadist Terror Attack Against Cruise Passengers Will Happen.
He estimates that the chance that ISIS will attack blue water objectives out of sight of land is still remote as long as navies of the world continue to provide a credible presence on the oceans. However coastal attacks like that committed by ISIS predecessor Al Qaeda againstthe USS Coleattack diagram aboveremain more probable. And he specifically cites the terrorist attacks last March at the Bardo museum in Tunis when cruise passengers from a Costa and MSC cruise ship were killed. He also citesa shorelaunched rocket attack on an Egyptian naval ship in August of last year.
Mr. Goldstein the President and Chief Operating Officer of the cruise line explained that his company makes a lot of effort into its security. Royal Caribbeans cruise ships call on approximately ports annually. Like other companies it makes judgments based on the security information it has received prior to calling on a port. Occasionally it will decide that it is not in the best interests of the cruise line and its guests to go to a particular port like the recent case of Bali which its Celebrity Solstice and Royal Caribbean Radiance of the Seas avoided.
Most places Royal Caribbean sails to are absolutely safe Mr. Goldstein claims.
He said that after the terrorist attacks last year in Paris there was a brief decline in business of a week or two from Northern Europe countries. He said the effect on his cruise line business was de minimis. He does not expect anything different after this latest attack in Brussels.
The FOX News panel also questioned Mr. Goldstein on the effect of the Zika virus on bookings. He also downplayed the effect of this serious medical problem which is believed to cause abnormally underdeveloped heads microcephalyin newborn children.
This is an interesting perspective. Yesterday another financial show on CNBC Jim Cramers MAD MONEY suggested that although cruise lines deny that the Zika virus has affected their operations to date itwill severely impact cruising in the coming months.
Hello this is Royal Caribbean International. We would like to provide you with some important information regarding your March sailing onboard Radiance of the Seas. In an abundance of caution and based on the latest security information we have gathered Royal Caribbean International has made a decision to cancel its call to Bali Indonesia on Thursday March . Additional ports of call have been added to your itinerary. A letter with additional details will be provided to you at boarding. We appreciate your understanding as your safety is always our foremost concern.
Last week sister cruise line Celebrity distributed lettersto the passengers and crew members on the Celebrity Solstice indicating that the cruise ship will not be calling on Bali Benoa due to the potential of a terrorist attack. You can read our article Celebrity Solstice Cancels Stop in Bali Due to Concern of Terrorism.
Today I received copies of letters handed out to the passengers and crew members on the Celebrity Solstice indicating that the cruise ship will not be calling on Bali Benoa due to the potential of a terrorist attack.
the most recent information received in the past few days indicates that the possibility of an incident has increased. Also the Balinese New Year on March th and recent past advisories has named this date as one that would be targeted by terrorists. Based on all of this information we have gathered from various sources and in discussion with our Global Security team in Miami we have made a decision to cancel our call to Bali.
The letter mentions not to nitpick that Celebrity felt that it could not guarantee passenger safety in Bali due to these concerns. Of course cruise lines have no legal duty to guarantee safety but only to act reasonably and to warn passengers of dangers which the cruise companies know or should know about ashore in ports of call.
It looks like Celebrity is acting prudently in taking steps to reduce the threat of harm to its passengers and crew. I have been critical in the past of cruise lines when they cruise passenger into dangerous ports of call like when Costa and MSC sailed into La Goulette Tunisia and ISIS slaughtered several dozen cruise passengers.
The letter sent to the Celebrity crew members today by the Solstices Executive Team mentions what is referred to as credible security concerns that led to the decision to bypass Bali. 
Many crew members are from Indonesia and will now be unable to visit with their family and loved ones.
The Bali bombings photo above occurred in October of in the tourist district of Kuta on Bali. The attack killed over people including Australians Indonesians and people from more than other nationalities. An additional people were also injured.
Jemaah Islamiyah members a violent Islamist group supported by alQaeda were convicted of engaging in the bombings which involved the detonation of a backpack bomb by a suicide bomber and a large car bomb. Three of the terrorists were executed. A recording from Osama Bin Laden stated that the Bali bombings were in retaliation for support of the United States war on terror and Australias role in the liberation of East Timor.
The Jakarta Post recently published an article stating that cruise tourism is increasing in Bali the countrys most famous tourist destination. In cruise ships arrived on the island. 
Trave Agent Central points out that Celebritys sister cruise line Royal Caribbean which shares the same Global Security team is sailing the Radiance of the Seas to Bali later this month as well as in April.
Military.com reports that retired U.S. Admiral James Stavridis stated at a naval private industry conference that the next attack by Islamic State militants may be directed to a navy ship or a cruise ship.
He mentioned the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship by Palestinian militants who murdered JewishAmerican passenger Leon Klinghoffer.
The article mentioned that Commander Stavridis said that ships were most vulnerable when they were first getting underway and going out to sea not when they were pierside or out on the open ocean.If I were an Islamic State planner thats what I would be looking at he said.
This is one of the scenarios which I have mentioned in articles like al Qaeda Planned to Seize Cruise Ships Execute Passengers which I published four years ago andHow the Next Jihadist Terror Attack Against Cruise Passengers Will Happenwhich I published last year.
Some cruise lines have temporarily dropped ports in North Africa Tunisand in the eastern Mediterranean Turkey due to concerns with terrorist attacks. 
News accounts are reporting that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP arrested a cruise passenger in Miamion charges that he has outstanding arrest warrants for kidnapping as well as assault and battery.
The charges involve criminal allegations made in South Carolina. The newspapersaid the unidentified person is now awaiting extradition to South Carolina.
The above quote is rather bizarre because the man arrested is apparently an U.S. citizen who went on a cruise out of Miami which included a port in Jamaica. So the CBP should have arrested the cruise passenger on the assault and kidnapping charges at the beginning of the cruise rather than at the end.
The news release by the CBP is misleading and says that the man was arrested after he arrived here on a cruise ship from Jamaica. Of course there are no cruises which originate in Jamaica. 
The CBP boasts that the arrest demonstrates vigilance and dedication exercised every day by CBP officers to secure our homeland and safeguard our citizens. But the truth of the matter is that the CBP didnt bother to screen the cruise manifest and arrest the wanted man before he sailed from U.S. waters.
We have seen this problem many times. Read our article two years ago Are You Cruising with a Wanted Felon Five Passengers Arrested on Carnival Magic in Galveston.
This reveals a major flaw in the CBP which does not bother to review who is leaving the country on cruises. This person had an outstanding arrest warrant for serious violent felonies yet he was permitted on the unidentified cruise ship to mingle with passengers when potentially he posed a danger to others. 
The CBPs primary mission is antiterrorism it admits so it is inexcusable that it does not scrutinize passenger lists before cruise ships sail out of U.S waters. 
The Customs and Border Patrol should begin vetting the name of passengers before the cruise starts rather than screening passengers only at the end of the cruise. Unfortunately this is standard practice for the CBP which routinely permits rapists criminals with outstanding warrants and other misfits to board cruise ships. Then there is great fanfare at the end of the cruise when the CBP finally take a look at the ship manifest.
As we reported before cruise passengers Steven Mark Anthony Requena photo right age was arrested while disembarking the Carnival Inspiration at the Port of Tampa two year ago. His name was flagged by a sweep of the manifest of passengers by Homeland Security officials who determined that the passenger was wanted for sexual assault in addition to assault with a weapon and forcible confinement. The U.S. Marshals arrested Requena only after the cruise ship returned to port. Regretfully our federal government routinely looks at the ship passenger list only after the bad guys have already boarded the cruise ship.
It is one of the reasons why cruising is more dangerous that it should be. At a time when the world is focused on dealing with ISIS it is irresponsible for our Federal employees not to look at the passenger list before the cruise ship leaves a U.S. port.
Multiple news outlets in the U.K. are reporting that the U.K. naval commander for NATO is warning that ISIS presents a threat to shipping in the Mediterranean Sea.
The popular Daily Mail published UK Commander Warns Mediterranean Cruise Ships Could be Terror Targets.
Its a topic we cover often. It is our belief that cruise ships are woefully unprepared to address the threat of an ISIS attack on a cruise ship and when cruise passenger are sent ashore on excursions where they are particularly vulnerable. 
There are few travel writers willing to have a frank and realistic assessment of the vulnerability of cruise ships to terrorists.
Today the Telegraph published an articleAre Cruise Holidays Safe from Terrorismwritten by U.K. cruise travel specialist Jane Archer who in our assessment down played the threat or terror.
Ms. Archer also says that there is no evidence at all that terrorists have targeted cruise passengers in the past.
She also claims that cruise lines conduct stringent security checks on everyone embarking their ships. Luggage is put through Xray scanners just as it is at an airport before flying and passengers have to walk through detectors before being allowed on board.
Ms. Archers article is essentially a regurgitation of the talking points released by the cruise industrys trade organization Cruise Line International Association.
cruise tourists from a Costa and a MSC cruise ship were slaughtered when they disembarked excursion buses at the Bardo museum in Tunis with absolutely no security and no warnings even though it was widely known to these cruise lines that ISIS presented a danger in the region. The cruise lines cruised their guests into danger and should have sailed them elsewhere but didnt. Cruise lines are often motivated primarily by financial considerations not the safety and security of their passengers. 
Yes of course terrorists have targeted cruise passengers in the past. Putting aside the Achille Lauro terrorist attack back in the s the Rand corporation has more recently stated that cruise passengers are targets. CNN reported that al Qaeda contemplated seizing a cruise ship forcing the passengers to dress in orange Guantanamo Baylike suits and videotape their executions to inflict maximum terror on the public. Read al Qaeda Planned to Seize Cruise Ships Execute Passengers.Of course ISIS just targeted the cruise passengers excursion buses in Tunis.
Think that all passenger luggage is carefully screened for security purposes Ask yourself that question after readingPort of Miami Security Guards Arrested for Stealing Cruise Passenger iPads. Large quantities of drugs are also often smuggled aboard cruise ships by crew members without detection. If crew members or passengers can smuggle large quantities of drugs onto ships in luggage or taping the drugs to their bodies they can do the same with explosives.
U.S. immigrations officials typically do not review passenger manifests until after the cruise ship sails and arrest people with outstanding warrants only when the cruise ship returns to port. Are you about to cruise with a terrorist in the cabin next door Maybe. The Customs and Border Protection officials may arrest the bad guys but only if you make it back to port.
ISIS already blew up an Egyptian frigate at sea just last year photo above. As we all know Islamic extremists blew up the USS Cole many years ago by ramming a small boat packed with explosives into the naval ship killing many U.S. service men and women.
The warning signs are all there. Its your decision who to believe or disbelieve. Do you tend to trust the top NATOnaval commander for the U.K. or a cruise writer for the Telegraph
Yahoo Travel just interviewed me for its articleIs Your Cruise Ship Prepared for a Terrorist Attack
There are nearly comments to the article some of which are quite interesting to read.
The Yahoo article does not really touch upon the issue that cruise ships are largely unarmed. So regardless how you feel about the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution the cruise ships by and large dont have armed security guards. Contrary to people who want to believe that the ships are armed but the cruise lines dont want to tip their hand to the terrorists there is in fact no hidden cache of weapons ready to be deployed by the cruise ships security forces. 
Cruise ships are flagged in foreign countries like the Bahamas or Panama. The international Maritime Organization IMO has no authority to regulate the use of guns on these foreign flagged ship. The IMO does not even recommend that cruise ships have guns.
Are Cruise Lines Taking Adequate Steps to Protect Passengers from Pirate AttacksCruise Line Liability for Injuries to Passengers and Crew Members Caused by Pirate Attacks
Some cruise ships go as far as to install razor wire around the rails and position logs to be dropped on the pirates below if they run their skiffs up to the cruise ship. You can see a photo of this spectacle here.
As we explained in this article the IMO issued guidance on the use of armed guards on ships but stresses that it is still not recommending them. Instead it states that shipping companies should consider arming crew members or hiring private armed guards on board only after conducting a risk assessment subject to approval by the flag state. The IMO also recommends that shipping companies follow all laws and regulations imposed by that flag state regarding the use of armed guard apply to their vessels.
The only cruise ships which seems to permit weapons aboardare flagged in Italy which seems to have a different attitude towards guns and permits cruise ships flagged there like Costa to have weapons aboard.
A Costa ship got itself into a bit of scandal a couple of years ago when a female crew member was photographed holding a huge automatic weapon in the bridge of the cruise ship.The Italian newspaper Oggi published photographs of the attractive Romanian blonde Sasha Alexandra posing in the bridge of the Costa Atlantica. She was photographed next to the captain in a tight cocktail dress holding a large machine gun.
But cruise ships from Carnival Royal Caribbean or NCL flying the flags of the Bahamas or Panama have no weapons at sea.
Cruise lines cant even keep the Ranch Dressing filled at the salad bar . . You are fooling yourself if you think they would be able to fight off an armed boarding takeover attempt.
A Greek newspaper is reporting that the MSC Fantasia has been subjected to a search for explosives today after calling on Haifa.
The MSC cruise ship arrived today in the Bay of Souda near Chania in Crete. A Greek newspaper in Athens To Vima reports that suspicious passengers or explosives may be on board the ship.
The MSC ship carries passengers with a crew of people. The ship was originally headed for the port of Heraklion. The Coast Guard and other authorities at the Souda naval base were reportedly notified.
The newspaper says that the MSC Captain advised the authorities that the ship was changing course because of the weather and that a passenger apparently a German citizen had died and needed to be autopsied to determine whether the passenger died from cardiac causes as suspected. However the newspaper reports that the ship had already changed course for security reasons.
The article said that the recent terrorist attack inIstanbul by ISIS had raised an alert regarding terrorism including attacks on cruise ships sailing in the region.
A German newspaper contains a quote from MSC Cruises saying thatbad weather was the reason for the diversion. The cruise line said rumors of security issues are totally unfounded.
I would be interested in hearing what crew members and passenger have to say about the weather conditions at the time.
There nonetheless appears to be a heightened security alert following the terrorist attack in Turkey.
ABC News reported yesterday thatCrystal Cruises announced that it was canceling stops for the Crystal Symphony in Istanbul and Kusadasi Turkeyin response to ongoing security concerns.
The itineraries for Crystal voyages that set sail April and May will reportedly include destinations in Greece instead of Turkey.
U.S. cruise operators are being tight lipped about whether they are reasonably equipped to respond to security challenged presented by ISIS. However German tour operators recently admitted thatterrorism is their top challenge in . And German tourists may be rethinking their travel plans astourists have become terror targets.
The U.S. State Department has alerted its citizens of possible risks of travel due to increased terrorist threats. Current information suggests that ISIL aka Daesh alQaida Boko Haram and other terrorist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks in multiple regions. These attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics using conventional and nonconventional weapons and targeting both official and private interests.
The warning which technically ended on Tuesday advisesU.S. citizens to exercise vigilance when in public places or using transportation.
ISIS has claimed responsibility for a number of highprofile incidents including the October st bombing of a Russian airliner in Egypt killing people. on a flight fromSharm ElSheikh to St Petersburg and the recent November th attacks in Paris.
President Obama spoke this afternoon on the terror alert and stated that there is no specific and credible threat to the U.S. Even assuming that to be true there have no doubt been prior terrorist incidents which have affected cruise passengers. Cruise passengers from Costa and MSC cruise ships were massacred in Tunis last earlier this year. We have predicted how the next terrorist attack against a cruise ship will take place.
But what can a cruise passenger do Not much it seems. There is no right for a refund if theres a terrorist incident in a country where a cruise passenger is traveling to. Passengers from Viking River Cruises for example traveled around Paris in Viking buses after the recent attacks waiting for their cruises because they had no right to cancel their upcoming cruises. it goes without saying that the mere threat of an attack is a not legal basis to cancel a cruise with any reasonable expectation of obtaining a refund. ReadFive Myths About Travel Insurance and Terrorism.
Cruise Industry Believe Red Tape and Visa Restrictions are a Bigger Threat than Terrorism written by cruise fan and Mirror blogger Captain Greybeard suggests that the cruise line CEOs were downplaying the threat of terrorism this week at theSeatrade Europe conference held in Hamburg.
The Islamist Menace Shadowing This Sept. th written by former mayor of New York RudyGiuliani indicates that America is in denial of the increasing and diversifying jihadist threats of violence. Unlike President Obama who avoids any characterization of terrorism linked to Islamic radicalism Giuliani traces the threat of killing Americans in terror attacks squarely back to extremist interpretation of Muhammads call to jihad. He cites the murder of Jewish cruise passengerLeon Klinghoffer who was killed by Islamic terrorist terrorists while in his wheelchair and dumped into the Mediterranean Sea as an example of what can happen today. 
But families booking cruises to Mediterraneanports of call dont read history books. I doubt that percent of U.S. cruisers know the story of Leon Klinghoffer or could name the cruise ship he was slaughtered on.
This week I was contacted by cruise passengers who were upset that their cruises to Istanbul were canceled. They scoffed when the captain mentioned the threat of terrorism as an explanation.
ISIS radicals today present a threat far more widespread and deadly than the PLO terrorists of the s. Are cruise passengers in denial Yes of course.No one wants to contemplate terrorism at sea during a holiday cruise any more than they wish to consider experiencing a cruise ship fire which is a relatively common occurrence as recent events illustrate.
Are cruise executives downplaying the threat of ISIS blowing up a ship or holding passengers hostage Such talk is bad for business. Other than occasionally canceling a port of two the cruise industry routinely sails through the Suez canal and to ports in Morocco Algeria and Egypt.
Dont assume that the cruise lines will avoid a dangerous port of call. Islamic terrorists killed cruise passengers in Tunisia earlier this year when Costa and MSC cruised blindly into the Goulette port in Tunis. Despite the foreseeable risk of danger presented by Islamic terrorists active in the country and in nearby Libya the cruise lines provided absolutely no security or warnings to their guests.

Celebrity Cruises canceled a stop in Istanbul earlier this week because of concerns with terrorism. We were the first to report on the cancellationinvolving the Equinox.
Today Celebrity canceled more port stopsannouncing that the Reflection will not stay in Istanbul on August st and will depart earlier in the day. Celebrity will also skip theReflections port call in Istanbul on September th th and will instead call on Athens.
On August th Costa canceled all port stops in Istanbul for the remainder of the year.
Costa and other cruise lines are under pressure not to sail more passengers into danger like Costa recklessly did when it cruised to Tunisia in March resulting in passengers being slaughtered. I called for the security chiefs to be sacked.
There are hundreds of cruises scheduled for Istanbul this year. Expect more cancelations

Today I received a message from a passenger aboard the Celebrity Equinox that the Equinox was skipping the port of Istanbul because of the threat of terrorism.
Gabriele Giambrone commented that Celebrity Equinox canceled our planned stop in Istanbul tomorrow due to terrorist fears and high security alerts. We will be having a day at sea instead.
The Wall Street Journal recently mentioned a spate of attacks across Turkey that targeted security forces and a U.S. consulate killed six people.
A recent surge in violence on Turkish soil has largely been blamed on the domestic conflict with Kurdish separatist group PKK not Islamic State . . . Turkey is now battling a chaotic mix of the PKK Marxist militants and Islamic State while dealing with a huge influx of Syrian refugees.
Royal Caribbean and Celebrity have a Global Security Team headed by former FBI senior official Gary Bald. Foreign port safety assessment is a function of every cruise line. Its good to see cruise lines taking affirmative steps to keep passengers and crew members safe rather than Costa and MSC sailing their guests blindly into a danger spot like Tunis earlier this year.

The images posted on Twitteryesterday of ISIS blowing up an Egyptian Navy frigate are frightening.
ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The SITE Intel Group says that the terrorists destroyed the naval ship with a guided missile. The images were widely broadcast. Time and Al Jazeeraand many other newspapers and news stations published them.
Is it foreseeable that ISIS will attack a cruise ship Of course but you would never know that if you rely on the cruise industry or your local travel agent for information and advice.
The cruise industry has a nonchalant view of terrorism. It reassures its customers that its allegedly safe to cruise in the Mediterranean. Costa and MSC and five other cruise lines scheduled calls in Tunis La Gouletteeven after the Bardo Museum massacre where cruise passengers were slaughtered. The second attack in Tunisia was predictable and came in June when a single radicalized Muslim with a Kalashnikov gunned down more tourists at the resorts in Sousse. 
Cruise ships sailing in Mediterranean waters are sitting ducks. I have been criticized before for explaining how the terrorists will attack cruise passengers as they sail off the Coasts of Tunisia Libya and Egypt. 
Terrorists have demonstrated that they can blown up a U.S. Navy vessel USS Cole years ago. When the jihdists want to focus the crosshairs of their weapons on a slow moving cruise ship they can easily do so. The only question is whether the action will be in the form of an external attack suicidal jihadists on a small boat with explosives ram the ship or the terrorists fire RPGs into the hull or whether the terrorists will try and board the ship and take the cruise passengers hostage and begin beheading them on video. 
MSC and Costa sailed their guests into danger in March when terrorists slaughtered cruise tourists as they exited into the Tunis museum excursion site from cruise buses transporting them from the port. The cruise lines neither provided nor arranged security for their customers or for that matter announced even a single warning of the risks of danger.
The cruise lines ignored the considerable risks posed by the ISIS and Al Queda terrorists growing in neighboring Libya and already festering in Tunisia. After the bloodshed the cruise industry quickly launched a PR campaign stating that cruising to Tunis was safe.
SoonMSC and Costa began rescheduling calls to Tunis notwithstanding the loss of life.
Princess Croisieres De France CDF Holland America Line Viking Ocean Cruises and Star Clippers also scheduled cruise ship to head to Tunis as reported by the Cruise Arabia website.
But then terrorists targeted a resort in Tunisia frequented by tourists. On June th tourists were killed. Terrible gruesome deaths. These were not cruise vacationers but mostly British and European families on holiday so the story was not portrayed as an attack on the cruise industry. 
Today theprime minister of Tunisia says that additional plots aimed at massive deaths are in the works. He earlier declared a state of emergency.
tourists to Tunisia were killed in the two deadly attack in Tunisia in the past three months. I suppose it doesnt really matter what the PR departments of the cruise lines say anymore. Their lack of credibility has been established. I believe MinisterHabib Essid when he says that the terrorists are plotting the deaths of tourists whether they arrive by cruise ship airplane or bus.
I reached out today on Twitter and Facebook to determine which cruise lines canceled their stops in Tunis. A couple of passengers tell me that Costa which canceled cruise after the March attacks but scheduled stops in August just canceled some of their calls later this summer. But no word from any travel agents or cruise lines for that matter whether they are still selling cruises to North Africa.
Thirty of the people killed in Sousse were British tourists. Britains Foreign Office warned tourists Thursday to leave Tunisia as soon as possible saying a further terrorist attack was highly likely.
National Geographicals ombudsman Christopher Elliott just published the article which I wrote for Yahoo Travel tiltedIs Cruising Safe A Chilling Look at an Industry Under Siege.
Elliotts article is titledTerrorists Target Cruise Ships Heres What You Need to Know Now.
The poll confirms what I suspected about the cruise industry that is is perceived by the public as pushing itineraries in the Middle East which are potentially dangerous with little concerned about the safety of the passengers.
Costa and MSC Cruises did not issue a single warning to their passengers before unloading them in Tunis. Both cruise lines were pushing excursions in Tunisia. Neither cruise line arranged for security for the buses targeted by the terrorists. The cruise excursion buses unloaded the passengers into a trap because of the negligence of the cruise lines.
Will the cruise industry wake up and protect their guests It seems that the public thinks that the cruise lines can do a lot more.

Tunisia acknowledges it. The risk of jihadists attacking tourists was readily foreseeable. Security analysts and security forces blew it.
In response to this failure Tunisia fired the countrys leading security experts as well as highrankingpolice officers.
Al Jazeera publishedSix Tunisia Police Chiefs Dismissed Over Museum Attack. The article explains thatTunisias prime minister Habas Essid fired six police commanders including those in charge of tourist security and intelligence teams. In addition apolice officer working at the museum was arrested for abandoning his post during the attack.Four other armed police officers were having coffees and a snack when terrorists struck the museum.
The Daily News publishedTunisia Fires Top Security Officials in Bardo Museum Attack Backlash.The article pointed out that the ousted officials include the director of Tunisias tourist police and the police chief for the neighborhood around the Bardo Museum.The decision was reportedly made after the prime minister visited the neighborhood of the attack and observed security problems. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi reportedly also criticized security failures around last weeks attack.
But what about the security chief at Costa and MSC including ship security officers and fleetwide security directors Why werent they fired They are just as responsible for the security failure. The cruise lines picked the port and sailed their guests into danger without any security protection or warnings. The cruise industry is not only refusing to take any responsibility for the massacre but the spokesperson for the Cruise Line International Association CLIAis boasting that cruise ships are a safe and secure place for our guests in the rare event of a shore side incident.
MSC Cruises USA CEO Rick Sasso told Travel Pulse There was no hint of terrorism or uncertainty in Tunisia before the attack . . . There are a zillion ports around the world and we follow all of them. . . There was nothing going on there that indicated this shouldve been a concern.
I am amazed how clueless this cruise executive sounds. Tunisian soldiers were engaged in ongoing battles against Al Qaeda there were prior suicides bombers which targeted hotels and museum attacks which targeted tourists. The UK issued a prior warning of a terrorist attack on tourist sites and the US repeatedly urged caution. ISIS was recruiting young men from mosques in Tunis to be trained and radicalized in Libya. And MSC sails in like everything is fine. 
Its a shame that the PR department at CLIA and the CEO of MSC areengaged in their usual irresponsible shenanigans and gobbledygook.

For the past couple of years Ive been troubled by the increasing violence in North Africa and the Middle East and the unprecedented nature of the cruelty of jihadist terrorists who have beheaded and burned infidels alive.I have worried about various scenarios where cruise passengers are at risk of attack.
We already know that al Qaeda has planned to seize cruise ships and execute passengers.
Our readers have sent us various scenarios of how cruise passengers are at risk on the high seas and in ports of call.
Think its far fetched Think again. Al Qaeda has already used this weapon to attack tankers in the Middle East. In the video below you can see the terrorists fire their weapons yell Allah Akbar God is Great and run off into the bushes. Cruise ships are easy targets over three football fields long and stories high moving at only a few knots an hours while entering and leaving ports. A RPG would slice though the aluminum hull like butter and cause fire damage injuries and death. Theyre sitting ducks without military escorts.
. . . This isnt about the ports and the safety of them. A terrorist could be among you at the buffet laying by the pool playing slots drinking at the bar they lay in wait. Theyre completely legitimate looking like one of us. of them could board a ship as a passenger with a clean record. Theyve been trained in other countries. Theyve lived in the countries theyre in for years and they lay in wait anticipating their marching orders. Then three days into the cruise they take over the ship and start killing passengers . . . And thats how itll go down.
The cruise industry needs to wake up. Tunis was preventable. Greater attention to Al Qaeda and ISIS is necessaryto avoid a similar if not worse attack on innocent passengers. Dangerous ports need to be avoided. In the past Princess Cruises used security teams police to accompany tour bus excursions in Egypt. Maritime security teams are also required in foreign ports of call to address the risk of waterborne attacks. Cruise lines are overflowing with cash. The cruise industry collects around billion a year pay their crew members peanuts and doesnt pay U.S. taxes. The industry needs to start investing some of those tens of millions of dollars into substantial security to keep their guests safe.

The cruise industrys favorite publication Travel Weekly just published an article titled After Tunis attack Impact on Cruise Sales Pondered.
The article speculates whether cruise sales will drop following the Islamic States massacre of cruise passengers in Tunis last week.
In the last couple of years first quarter wave sales were negatively impacted by the Costa Concordia disaster in January and the Carnival Triumph poop cruise in February . The article suggests that whereas the sinking and engine room fire could arguably be blamed on the cruise lines the public is not likely to fault the cruise lines for the terror attack last week.
I disagree with that premise. Costa and MSC sailed into a country with a history of fighting between Tunisian solders and Al Qaeda resulting in dozen of soldiers killed and wounded over the last two years. Tunisian men have been recruited to train in ISIS camps inLibya. There had been prior attacks against a popular museum in Tunisia and a suicide bomber blew himself up in a hotel frequented by tourists.What did the cruise lines think would happen after Tunisians were radicalized and trained to use automatic weapons in Libya and then returned home
The public can easily conclude that the cruise lines sailed their guests into harms way without warnings or any thought of providing security for the excursion buses.
But the cruise supporters are out in full force spinning the story to exculpate the cruise lines.
Bud Darr a mouthpiece for the Cruise Line International association CLIA argues that the terror attack against cruise passengers was not targeted at cruise passengers.
The editor of Cruise Week Mike Driscoll spun the attackoncruisepassengers as not a black eye for cruising because its not the cruise lines fault and it didnt happen on a ship.
Travel Weekly interviewed a travel agent who said I think were all keeping our fingers crossed that this will not have a negative impact.
Travel Weekly published statements from the Cruise Line International Association CLIA who claims that cruise lines have worked for many years with security and law enforcement authorities around the world to ensure passenger safety. CLIA claims that it hasprocedures to provide an immediate and effective response to any securityincident.
The day before the attack the cruise executives were salivating over expanding their markets into North Africa and making greater profits. Their minds were on money not security. 
A former cruise line security chief was highly critical of the absence of any security for the Costa and MSC cruise passengers. 
CLIA and Travel publications like Travel Weekly will continue issuingstatements and publishing stories claiming that cruise passengers are safe and sound in North Africa and the Middle East. But thespecter of dead passengers certainly will scare customers away and drive down cruise sales especially in the Mediterranean. If the cruise industry is going to cross its fingers it better be in the hope that ISIS doesnt target a cruise ship.

As the death toll increases in Tunis the former Director of Princess Cruises says that cruise security was lax and the cruise lines failed to assess the danger associated with sailing passengers into Tunis.
Commander Mark Gaouette told IHS Maritime that cruise security measures for passengers should have been stronger.
I believe the risk management process failed to properly assess the extremely volatile situation in North Africa he said.
. . . at a minimum more security should have been required for that excursion in the form of armed police or military escort and armed presence at the museum itself.
The death and injury tally ranges around dead and to passengers injured.
I remain amazed that the Costa captain piloted the Costa Fascinosa out of the port in Tunis and left passengers behind not knowing whether they were dead or injured. I cant help but think of Costa Captain Schettino leaving passengers behind as he fled the sinking Concordia in Giglio. Do I have this wrong To give the Fascinosacaptain the benefit of the doubt I can only assume that he may have been concerned that terrorists might attack the ship itself and slam RPGs into its hull or gun their way up the gangway and look for hostages. In that sense maybe it was prudent to escape the port as soon as possible although it begs the question why Costa was there in the first place. 
Why any cruise line would sail into Tunis is beyond me. In and many dozens ofTunisian soldiers were killed and even more injured in deadly attacks perpetrated by alQaeda and other Islamic fighters according to an article titled Terror and Politics in Tunisia in the publication World Affairs. Tunisia is a major recruiting ground for ISIS. Recruits are trained in Iraq Syria or Libya and then return to Tunisia radicalized. 
Costa and MSC have stated that they will not call on Tunisia in the foreseeable future. To me thats like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted as the saying goes. Whether these cruise ships will actually stay away remains to be seen. We have seen cruise lines announce with great fanfare that they are leaving a Caribbean port after a cruise passenger or employee has been killed ashore. They always return after the media attention dies down.

Newspapers are reporting that severalgunmen stormed a popular museum in Tunis Tunisia today killing tourists as well as a police officer and Tunisian civilians. Some news accounts report that as many as two dozen people were also injured.
Two cruise ships were in port and had sent thousands of passengers into the city on excursions. CNN says that some of the cruise passengers were at the museum at the time of the attack. The Daily Mail reports that aTunisian tourist guide told how he stared death in the face as terrorists opened fire on his clients in the attack which saw people shot as they exited cruise ship buses parked outside the museum.
CBS News says that the terrorists targeted tourist buses when they arrived at the museum. The terrorists dressed in police uniforms then opened fire on the tourists before they could reach the museum. 
On the occasion of today scheduled call some guests on cruise on board our Costa Fascinosa had a tour in the city. All the shore excursions organized by Costa during today stop in Tunis have been immediately recalled on board the company said in a statement. 
The Italian newspaper stated that the Bardo museum is visited regularly by tourists with many disembarking from Mediterranean cruises.
Commentators believe that the group is affiliated with an Islamic terrorist organization like ISIS. Tunisia is a major recruiting ground for ISIS.

One question I am asked frequently is whether Islamic terrorists pose a threat to cruise ships. I received a couple of such inquiries in the last week. One from a mother in the U.K. whose son works on a cruise ship sailing the Mediterranean and another from the father of a family in the U.S. thinking about taking a cruise from Spain to France Italy Greece and Turkey and back. 
Yesterday several newspapers in Europe and the Middle East Mail OnlineAl Arabiya News interviewed experts who have painted the scenario of speed boats operated by Islamic State terrorists attacking fishing boats cruise ships and small merchant ships to capture people and parade them in orange jumpsuits before a video with a knife to their neck. 
We have all seen the stories on CNN about the gruesome killing and beheading of innocent aid workers and journalists by ISIS in an effort to terrorize the televised world. In the last two weeks we have also read stories about the barbaric burningaliveinacage of the Jordanian pilot and the beheading of twentyone Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya. We are of course all afraid to actually see the videos of the terrifying violence.
As we sit in front of the television in our homes here in the U.S. we all feel safe from the terrorists dont we The beheadings are after all over there in foreign places like Iraq Syria Yemen Libya and other unstable Arab countries.
But when U.S. citizens decide to fly to Europe and go on a cruise vacation with their family in the Mediterranean are they placing themselves in harms way
The thought of Muslim terrorists hijacking a cruise ship is hardly new.Achille Laura instantly comes to mind. Forcing terrified cruise ship hostages into orange suits and executing them al Queda has already planned thatjust a couple of years ago. CNN would cover the terror nonstop.
There are numerous studies by security companies and U.S. governmental organizations which have studied terrorist organizations and concluded that terrorism against cruise ships is likely.
The World Cruise Industry Review publication concluded several years ago that a likely terrorist scenario is the hijacking of a cruise ship and its passengers while terrorists kill passengers if demands are not met.
The issue has been discussed by a number of experts including Commander Mark Gaouette who is the former director of security for Princess. He wrote a book Cruising for Trouble which specifically addresses the potential of a cruise ship as a target for terrorists.
years ago U.S. service men and women were brutally murdered when Islamic suicide bombers rammed their speed boat loaded with explosives into the U.S. navy ship the U.S. Cole.
If the U.S. Navy cant protect its military fleet what chances do thousands of U.S. tourists think they have of staying safe on a gigantic U.S. based cruise ship floating like a sitting duck in the harbor ofSharm elSheikh Egypt
ISIS has already taken over port cities in Libya which is strategically located in the middle of North Africa. It would be easy for ISIS to launch a suicide jihadbysea against cruise ships sailing to or from North Africa and the Middle East.
Jihadists are already using cruise ships to sneak into war zones says the Maritime Executive.The fear is that the radicals will shift their focus to making the ship itself the war zone.
Families thinking of cruising in the Pacific Northwest Seattle Vancouver Alaska may be reasonably safe from an ISIS attack. A terrorist attack seems extremely unlikely to happen in the Caribbean. But sailing into a port in Morocco Tunisia or Egypt on a cruise ship Its not a matter of if. Its just a matter of when.
The Associated Press AP reports that jihadi fighters are increasingly buying tickets on cruise ships to join extremists in battle zones in Syria and Iraq.
The AP states that jihadists are tryingto bypass travel restrictions in neighboring Turkey.
According to the APTurkey says that it has been deporting hundreds of terrorists caught in airports and bus stations. But there are some fighters or more from countries traveling to the Middle East to fight for extreme Islamic causes.
The BBC reports that Islamic militants areusing of cruise ships more and more.
Originally our concern about people on cruise ships dangerous people on cruise ships really focused on the classic sort of rapist burglar or violent criminal. But as weve gathered data weve realized that there are more and more reports that people are using cruise ships in order to get to launch pads if you will sort of closer to the conflict zones of Syria and Iraq.
Terrorism is a concern for any kind of international travel. The current news does not suggest an attack by such groups on cruise ships but there is historical evidence of such attacks.We have written about plans uncovered two years ago by al Qaeda to seize cruise ships and dress passengers in orange jump suits and execute them. Three decades ago Arab terrorists killed cruise passengerLeon Klinghoffer on the Achille Lauro cruise ship and a decade ago our U.S. Navy lost several dozen sailors who were blown up during the attack on the U.S.S. Cole by an al Qaeda group.
Several readers of Cruise Law News sent us articles today reporting that Greek police officers boarded the Costa Magica while it was in the Port in Piraeus Greece and arrested four passengers who had possession of firearms. 
The Croatian newspaperSlobodna Dalmacija Daily reports that the incident occurred on Thursday October nd.
Approximately other passengers embarked from Venice on a sevenday Mediterranean cruise. Once the ship reached Greece the Greek police boarded the Magica and arrested one woman and three men for possession of firearms pistols.
The cruise ship was delayed departing from Piraeus because of the incident. The incident was not announced on the ship and the passengers seemed to be unaware of it.
The newspaper says that the news about the arrest of four passengers could not be found either in the Greek or in the Italian media. The newspaper interviewed crew members from Dubrovnik who explained the circumstances surrounding the arrests.
The newspaper say that the information was suppressed because it was bad for the cruise industrys business.
Those interviewed explained that there are passengers and suitcases simultaneously screened in just a few hours and it is impossible to effectively screen so many passengers and luggage in such little time.
This is particularly worrying the newspaper suggested when the Islamic states repeatedly threaten harm to the Americans and their allies.
The article is entitled The Terrorists Tried to Hijack the Cruise Ship with Passengers.
There is no indication why the passengers had the guns nor is there any proof or explanation in the newspaper that they were in fact terrorists.

A number of news sources are reporting that the Tunisian government prohibitedIsraeli passengers from disembarking from a cruise ship at a stop at the Port of Tunis.
Norwegian Cruise Line NCL a U.S.based cruise line told the Israeli citizensthat they were not welcome by the Tunisian government and had to stay aboard the cruise ship.
Bnai Brith Canada released a statement yesterday stating that there were approximately Israelis on board the NCLship. They did not know in advance that they could not leave the ship during the port of call.
According to the Jewish Telegraphic AgencyJTA the cruise line had a responsibility to its passengers and to advise them of this discriminatory policy in advance Bnai Brith Canada CEO Frank Dimant said in a statement. Better still the cruise line should avoid ports that have such policies.
During Norwegian Jades port call in La Goulette Tunisia on Sunday March a small number of guests holding Israeli passports were not allowed to go ashore because of a last minute decision made by the Tunisian Government. Port taxes for the call in Tunisia are being refunded to these guests.
We apologize for any inconvenience to our guests and appreciate their understanding. We are reviewing this decision with the appropriate officials.
NCLs statement is pathetic. NCL should not be downplaying the incident like this. The Tunisian governments action should be immediately and unequivocally denounced in the strongest language possible. 
This is not about returning nominal port taxes to inconvenienced guests. It is about much deeper and important issues. No citizens of any nation should be subjected to such discrimination. The fact that an Arab nation would exhibit such contempt and hostility against Israel is particularly despicable.
What lessons were learned from the hijacking of the Achilles Lauro cruise ship and the murder of passenger Leon Klinghoffer Have we forgotten his death and the terror inflicted by an Arab terrorist group against cruise ship passengers in the Mediterranean and ending in the murder of a Jewish passenger 
Tunisias actions sent a clear message to Israeli citizens. NCLs response should be equally clear. The only reasonable action is for NCL and the cruise industry to boycott Tunis as a port.
We want to send a strong message to Tunisia and ports around the world that we will not tolerate such random acts of discrimination against our guests. We are outraged by this act and the fact that we were not notified in advance of this practice. We apologize sincerely to our guests who were affected and want them to know that we have taken the appropriate action in response.
NCL announced the boycott during the Cruise Shipping Miami CSM today. I walked by the Tunisia delegation photo left. They must be feeling rather foolish.
Newspapers in Cyprus and Israel are reporting that security forces in Cyprus thwarted a planned terror attack against Israeli tourists.
Cypriot security forces seized a powerful explosive in the port of Limassol local paper Alithia reported. The explosive was described as capable of causing massive damage.
The newspapers state that the perpetrators intended to target Israeli tourists visiting on cruise ships to Cyprus which is a popular tourist destination for Israelis.
Earlier this summer Cyprus arrested a Lebanese man with links to Hezbollah who was planning attacks on Israelis in the country. Israel has said the attacks were part of a concerted effort by Iran which employs the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah as its proxy to target Israelis around the world.
Years After Hijacking of Achille Lauro Can Cruise Ships Keep Passengers Safe in the MiddleEast
In April I blogged about a plot where Arab terrorists envisioned hijacking a U.S. based cruise ship forcing the passengers to wear orange Guantanamolike jump suits and then videotaping their execution.
There are numerous studies by security companies and U.S. governmental organizations which have studied terrorist organizations and concluded that terrorism against cruise ships is likely.
The issue has been written about by a number of experts including Commander Mark Gaouette who is the former director of security for Princess cruise line. He wrote a book specifically addressing the issue of cruise ships as a target for terrorists.
Twentyseven years ago today the world saw terrifying television images of Palestinian terrorists holding passengers aboard the Achille Lauro cruise ship hostage. The terrorists demanded the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
There were over nationalities of passengers booked on the cruise but the terrorists stated that Americans would be the first to be executed if their demands were not met. 
Leon Klinghoffer age was from New York City and was vacationing with his wife Marilyn and their friends when the Achille Laurosailed for Port Said Egypt. Although Mr. Klinghoffer was disabled and in a wheelchair the terrorists picked him to be the first to die. They shot him in the chest and head and then forced two crew members to dump him and his wheelchair over the side of the cruise ship.
That terrible crime occurred in October . Now years later are cruise passengers particularly Americans any safer
We have seen civil unrest across North Africa. President Mubarek is gone from Egypt and Colonel Gaddafi of Libya is dead. Good riddance to both I saybut both countries now seem more dangerous to Americans than ever. Last month we saw antiAmerican demonstrations on the anniversary in both of these countries and the murder of the U.S. Ambassador to Libya in Benghazi.
On the front page above the crease of the New York Times this morning are several articles about violence in Syria with a photo of a Syrian firing a Kalashnikov rifle. I not sure who is fighting who anymore but they all seem to have the potential to take their violence to U.S. interests.
In April I blogged about a plot where Arab terrorists envisioned hijacking a U.S. based cruise ship forcing the passengers to wear orange Guantanamolike jump suits and then videotaping their execution.
years after Leon Klinghoffers dead body was dumped into the Mediterranean Sea the danger of terrorism against cruise ship passengers seems greater than ever before. Have cruise ships increased the number of security guards aboard their cruise ships I doubt it. Every cabin occupied by a security guard means less revenue for the cruise lines. 
The current strategy seems to be to simply skip ports in Egypt Morocco and Tunisia until things calm down. But thats a short turn fix when the street protests are over there remains the risk of jihadists plotting a cruise ship to target. Will the cruise security teams be ready
If terrorists can overpower several heavily armed U.S. Marines and kill our Ambassador in Libya does anyone really think that they are safe sailing on a Holland America Line or Princess cruise ship sailing into Tunis or Port Said
The disturbing trend of violence against the U.S. in places like Libya and Egypt is causing the cruise lines to scramble to swap out ports of call in North Africa for ports in Italy and Malta.
HALs Ryndam skipped a port Tunisia yesterday and instead visited Sardinia Italy.Royal Caribbeans Mariner of the Seas will avoid Alexandria Egypt next week and will call on Sicily and Valletta Malta on the next two days.Cunards Queen Elizabeth skipped a call today in Alexandria and will visit Rhodes tomorrow.
In April I blogged about a plot where Arab terrorists envisioned hijacking a U.S. based cruise ship forcing the passengers to wear orange Guantanamolike jump suits and then videotaping their execution.
There are numerous studies by security companies and U.S. governmental organizations which have studied terrorist organizations and concluded that terrorism against cruise ships is likely. Take a look at this report by the RANDorganization.
When I was a kid my family lived in Tripoli Libya starting in until the s. The Libyan people back then mostly Sunni Muslims were peaceful. But today Libya Egypt Tunisia or Morocco are the last places on earth I would sail my family to. 
Cruise ships are simply not equipped to handle a terrorist attack. Cruise ship security cant even handle drunk passengers. And I would not trust the port authorities in these Arab countries to provide adequate protection against Islamic fanatics strapped with explosives who would love to blow up a cruise ship with Americans aboard.
There is a disturbing story today in CNN entitled Documents Reveal al Qaedas Plans to Seize Cruise Ships . . . The CNN article explains that an alQaeda operative was caught with encoded digital data which once deciphered revealed some of the terror groups most audacious plots and a road map for future operations. 
The terrorist group had far reaching plans to conduct operations in Europe and to kill cruise ship passengers as part of its reign of terror.
Musharbash takes that to mean that the terrorists would then start executing passengers on those ships and demand the release of particular prisoners.
The plan would include dressing passengers in orange jump suits as if they were al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and then videotaping their execution.
Are cruise ships prepared to deal with a well organized attack by a jihadist terrorist organization 
Do you believe that the cruise industry has done enough to protect passengers from terrorism or are cruise vacationers sitting ducks Please leave a comment below.
CBS Channel reported today that acheck of a suspicious package at thePort of Miami resulted in the evacuation of a cruise ship terminal. The evacuation was orderedaftera police dog alerted to the package.
Miami police ordered the evacuation of Terminal C which was in use Friday by NCLsNorwegian Sky cruise ship. CBS reported that the evacuation covered only cruise and port employees working in the terminal becausecruise passengers arriving Friday had yet to be allowed inside to board Fridays cruise.
The MiamiDade bomb squadand HazMat crews were was called to check the package. A port official eventually said the package turned washarmless.
The AP is reporting thata twentythree year man whohad apparently been placed ona nofly listtraveled from Oregon to New Yorkby train and then boarded a cruise ship in order to sailto England.
The article identifiesMichael Migliore as a Muslim convertwhohad tried unsuccessfully for months to fly to Italy where he planned to live with his mother.
According to the AP Miglioresaysheis on the nofly listbecause he refused to cooperate with FBI agents who wanted to question him after an acquaintance was charged in a plot to bomb a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland.
After being barred from flying Mr.Migliore decided to travel across the U.S. by train and then sail on a cruise ship to Europe. Once he arrived in England the British police arrested him.
Now this strikes me as rather strange. I dont know Mr. Migliore.I have no idea whether he is a potential terrorist threat or a nice guywho was arbitrarily labeled a threat because he converted to Islam. I tend to sympathize with U.S. citizenshavingtheir liberties taken away withoutnotice or due process.
But ifthe U.S. really placed him on a nofly list because of a good faith belief that he is prone to blow up a airplane whydidnt it place him on a nocruise list Thisstarted me thinking is there such a thing as a nocruise list If not why not If you are inclinedto take down an aircraft it seems like a cruiseship is an equally attractive target.
Does the Transportation Safety Administration TSA Homeland Securitythe FBIand Customs and Borderpeopleshare information of potential dangers in the air and on the sea If sowhy is someone who is such a danger to be placedon a nofly list permitted to board a cruiseship for a transatlantic cruise
This weekendour television has alternated between college football games and documentaries about the horror of .
Iwas in my office talking to Dad who was with my Mom visiting my sister in Park City Utah. I waswith him on thetelephone when the first tower began to fall.I remember himyellingholy shit son the tower is falling We then both hung upto watch the spectacle.
There have been some insightful articles about how disruptedourlives and changed our perspective of the world around us. The Connecticut Post published an interesting article A September Cruise Leads Passenger Home to a Changed City which is the account of a real estate agent in Connecticut who goes with her husband on a cruisefrom Southamptonwhen the plane struck the twin towers.
The towers were a landmark that seemed to always be in the background of every cruise ship photographed in New York harbor. I found such a photo and thought it might beappropriate to add it to this article. But while uploading it I realized that it shows the H.M.SBritaniswhichsank off of the coast of South Africa in October .
to me brought home the fact that all of us arehere onplanet earth for a limited period of time. Great buildings can fall before our eyes. Magnificent ships can sink out of sight as if they never existed. Loved ones can leave us.

The Tribune newspaper in the Bahamas is reporting that a pleasure cruise on board the Discovery cruise ship turned into terror and aggravation for hundreds of passengers when a bomb threat stopped the shipat night en route to Port Everglades in Ft. Lauderdale. The incident began whenMiami Dade Police Department received a call around PMthat a man was aboard the shipwitha gun and a bomb.
The Discovery cruise ship ship leftGrand Bahama with approximately passengers around PM. The fivehour cruise back toPort Everglades usually arrives around . PM.
The newspaper indicates that passengers were restricted to their cabins and in certain areas of the ship while the search was conducted. The newspaper also quotes a passenger stating that everyone was very scared and some persons were even upset because of the long delay and late arrival into Fort Lauderdale.
If you were a passenger aboard the Discovery please leave a comment about the experience below.
One of theproposals recommended bythe International Cruise Victims ICV organization ishaving sea marshals on cruise ships in order to protect passengers and respond to shipboard crimes.
Since the Federal government has placedair marshals on airplanes. The ICV has attempted to ensure that cruise ships have the same level of security by supporting legislation in California requiringsea marshals on all cruise ships entering and departingcruiseports in that state.
Unfortunately the cruise industry fought againstan independent police force on cruise ships.The typical argument is that state law enforcement have no jurisdiction over foreign flag cruise ships on international waters. However there is no question that states like California have jurisdiction to place sea marshals on cruise ships once the ships reach state waters to act as a police presence andto monitor environmental activities. Alaska has a very effective sea marshal program designed to monitor cruise ship waste waterdumping.
The port of Los Angeles already has a sea marshal program. By all accounts it is successful and serves the valuable purpose of protecting passengers. As explained in an article today Marshals Defend Port of L.A. in the Contra Costa Timesthe port of Los Angeles hassixsea marshals as well asan additional eight to port police officers who are trained to join the team.The L.A. sea marshal program is seperate from the sea marshal program operated by the U.S. Coast Guard which board vessels up to milesoffshore.
The sea marshal program in L.A. isgeared toward addressing vulnerabilities ascruise ships and cargo vesselhead into and out oftheharbor.Sea marshals boardcruise ships miles from port. They arearmed. They make sure that no one forces their way into the bridge tohijackthe ship and uses itasa floating bomb or abattering ram just as alQaida terrorists forced their way into the cockpits of jetliners on .
Sea marshals also inspect various areas of the cruise ship look for explosives drugs suspicious activities and coordinateunderwater inspections byport police divers once thecruise shipsreach port. Theyremain onthe bridge where they keepwatch asthe cruise ships sail out of the Port of Los Angeles. They return to port once the vessels reach miles offshore.
It remains less than clear whether the sea marshalsin Los Angeleshave responsibility to handle reports of crime which occur at sea as the cruise ships sail back to California. Undoubtedly the local sea marshals can liason with the Los Angeles Port Police andthe FBI.
Los Angeles has proven that a sea marshal programon a state level can work. More ports and states need to followLos Angeless lead.
This month is the th year anniversary of the death ofcruise ship passenger Leon Klinghoffer an American Jewwho was killed byPalestinianterrorists who hijacked the cruise ship he was sailing on with his wife in the Mediterranean Sea in .
Mr. Klinghoffer age wasfrom New YorkCity and was vacationingwith his wifeMarilyn and their friends when fourheavily armedterrorists hijacked the Achille Lauro cruise shipafter it left Port SaidEgypt. Although Mr. Klinghoffer was disabled and in a wheelchair the terroristsshot him in the chest and head and then forced two crew members to dumphim and the wheelchair he was confined to over the side of the cruise ship.
The terrorists demanded the captain sail the cruise ship to Syria andIsrael release Palestinian prisoners.After a twoday drama the hijackers surrendered in exchange for a pledge of safe passage out of Egypt to Tunisia.But when an Egyptian jet tried to fly the hijackers away from justiceU.S. Navy F fighters intercepted the jet and forced it to landin Sicily. The terrorists were taken into custody by Italian authorities. The four terrorists were convicted and sentenced to jail but a mediator Abu Abbas from thePalestinian Liberation Army PLO who planned the hijacking waspermitted to leave Italy to the outrage of Americans. The U.S. Army subsequently captured Abbasduring the invasion of Iraq.
The tragicincident isknownfor the brutalnature of the Palestinian terrorists against Mr. Klinghoffer the involvement of the PLOand the bold action of President Reagan in foiling the terroristsescape.
But thetheincidentis also well known in legal circles fordemonstrating the extraordinary steps which cruise linestake to limit their liability.
Mrs.Klinghofferand the estate of Leon Klinghoffer daughters LisaandIlsa were the administrators filedsuit in the Southern District of New York against the owner operator chartererof the Achille Laurotravel agenciesvarious other defendants and eventually the PLO. Other passengers who were aboard the Achille Lauro during the hijacking also filed suit.
The familiessued the cruise linedefendantsfor failing to have adequate security to protect the passengers from the terrorist attack.
The cruise ship was operated by the Lauro Line and marketed by the Chandris Line whose risk management department was based in New York City. The claims supervisorsubsequently went to workfor Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises.
Rather than trying to reach a settlement with the grieving family the cruise line defendants threw upevery obstacle imaginable to prevent the Klinghoffer family from obtaining compensation. The cruise linedenied responsibility and claimed that the attack was unforseeable. They filed motionsto dismiss claiming that they did not engage inbusiness in the U.S. They argued that the forum selection clause which we have discussed inother articles in the passenger ticket limited their liability to only and in any eventanylawsuithad to bebrought in Naples Italy.The cruise line defendant thenfiled claims against the PLO arguing thatif anyone should be responsible for Mr. Klinghoffers death it was the PLO for planningthe hijacking of the cruise ship.
The lawsuits lasted over years at great emotional and financial expense of the Klinghoffer family.
Finally the cases were resolved shortly before trial when the PLO made a confidential financial settlement which resulted in the creation of a nonprofit organization the Leonand Marilyn Klinghoffer Memorial Foundation.
As a result of the ordealour U.S. Congress enacted legislation which provides a basis to sue terrorist organizations when they are involved in the deaths of U.S. citizens.Cruise lines however remain free to use forumselection clauses and contractual limitations of liability to make it difficultfor Americans to obtain compensation.
The lastingmaritime law implications ofMr. Klinghoffers death is thatno cruise line can realisticallyclaim that the hijacking of a cruise ship by a terrorist organization isunforeseeable given the vivid memories of that terrible day twenty five years ago on the Achille Lauro.
Daughters Keep Up Terror Fight for Leon Klinghoffer years after Attack on Achille LauroNY Daily News
I responded immediately that it was in violation of international law and morally indefensible.
For those cruise fans who are not current on international news two days agoIsraelicommandos boardedacruise shipin international waters.The ship is the MV Mavi Marmarapassenger ship formerly owned and operated by a Turkish ferry company and now owned by a Turkish Islamist charity the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedom and Humanitarian Relief. TheMavi Marmara with around Palestinian supporters was sailingwith food toys andrelief supplies for Palestiniansin Gaza.Israel boarded the ship to enforce an embargo of Gaza.
Passengers on the cruise ship called activists in many press accounts attackedthe commandos after they rappelled from a helicopter. Watch the video below. Whenthe violence ended Israeli forces had killed passengers and injured others. The passengers injured Israeli soldiers critically.
My opinion remains that this was a clear violation of international maritime law. TheU.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea entitlesvessels free passage on the high seas. It was also amorally indefensible attack on citizens in international waters. I received a lot of flak for my opinions. There are few peoplein the U.S. based cruise industry orcourthouses in Miami who have much sympathy for the Palestinian cause particularly after . The U.S. is preoccupied withfighting the war on terror and in theprocessevery Arab relief agency is labeled as a tool for AlQaeda Hamas or Hezbollah.
But putting politics aside this is a straight forward issue. International law prohibits the boarding of vessels in international waters. Attacking a relief ship in this manner is as illegal as engaging inpiracyoff of the coast of Somalia.
Some argue that Israel has the right to enforce the embargo and make certain that humanitarian shipments into Gaza do not include weapons.This may sound good butit presupposes that the embargo is legal.The siege of Gaza is wrong and severely punishes Palestinians by depriving them of food medical supplies and basic services. TheU.N.told Israel to end the embargoin the first place.
International law also requires that onlyproportionalforce may be used in the face of violent resistance. Yes the commandos were met with violence when they illegally boarded the vessel on the high seas.You can see this clearly in the video. But shooting protesters in the head with automatic weapons is not proportional or morally defensible particularly when the commandos had no right to board the ship in the first place.
The local news media is reporting that Royal Caribbean recently received a bomb threataboard theLiberty of the Seas cruise ship.
There have been a number of bomb threat hoaxes recently. Perhaps themost publicized one was when a passenger from VirginianamedIbrahim Khalil Zarou who was reportedly quite intoxicated Bomb Hoax Gets Drunken Carnival Cruise Passenger Arrested
Fortunately these bomb threats turned out to be hoaxes. But what if they were real
In this most recent bomb threat the FBI and other federal agencies did not board the cruise ship until eleven hours later.
Are cruise lines equipped to handle a real terrorist threat on the high seas Most cruise lines have as few as or security guards on duty at night and some lines do not monitor their surveillance camerasexcept in the casinos. Is this adequate security for to passengers and crew
Our experiencesuggeststhat the few security personnel on cruise shipshave a difficult enough time deterring or responding to bar fights between drunken passengers. A realterrorist threat on the high seas will pose a real problemto the cruise industry.
CBP Will Study Costs of Requiring Cruise Ships to Hand Over Their Passenger Reservation Data
Charlelie Carrier left and his mother Gladys Chamberland right were among the six Quebecers killed in a terrorist attack in Burkina Faso on Jan. .
Six Canadians died in an attack on a luxury hotel in Burkina Faso Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday as the Quebec government confirmed all six were from the province.
Four of the victims were from the same family and had been in the country for nearly a month to aid in the construction of a school.
Retired teacher Yves Carrier and his wife Gladys Chamberland who worked for the national resources ministry were killed along with their two children Maude and Charlelie. They lived in LacBeauport in the Quebec City region. The two other victims from Quebec were Louis Chabot and Suzanne Bernier both close to the family.
Maude Carrier was killed in a terrorist attack in Burkina Faso on Jan. .
Four jihadist attackers linked to alQaida were killed by Burkina Faso and French security forces hours after they stormed the Splendid Hotel and nearby Cappuccino Cafe establishments popular with westerners in the West African countrys capital of Ouagadougou. At least died in the attacks from different countries.
Trudeau issued a statement strongly condemning the attack that began late Friday and ended Saturday.
On behalf of all Canadians we offer our deepest condolences to the families friends and colleagues of all those killed and a speedy recovery to all those injured. We are deeply saddened by these senseless acts of violence on innocent civilians he said.
Yves Carrier his wife Gladys and two children Maude and Charlelie were killed in an attack on a Burkina Faso hotel on Jan. .
Three attackers were killed at the hotel and a fourth was killed when security forces cleared out a second hotel nearby. Two of the three attackers at the Splendid Hotel were identified as female President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said on national radio.
He said at least hostages were freed in part by French forces who arrived overnight from neighbouring Mali to aid in the rescue.
The attack was launched by the same extremists behind a similar siege at an upscale hotel in Bamako Mali in November that left dead.
An alQaida affiliate known as alQaida in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility online as the attack was ongoing in downtown Ouagadougou at the room hotel according to the SITE Intelligence Group.
Conservative leader Rona Ambrose extended her condolences to the families of the Canadians killed but also called on the governing Liberals to take every measure to combat terrorism including rethinking plans to withdraw fighter jets from the fight against the Islamic State.
These ongoing attacks are proof that decisive action is required to confront this threat including fully supporting our coalition allies and keeping our CFs in the fight in Iraq and Syria Ambrose said in a statement.
Burkina Faso a largely Muslim country had for years been largely spared from the violence carried out by Islamic extremist groups who were abducting foreigners for ransom in neighbouring Mali and Niger. Then last April a Romanian national was kidnapped in an attack that was the first of its kind in the country.
Canada and Burkina Faso have had a diplomatic relationship since according to the Department of Global Affairs adding that Canada is the countrys largest foreign investor.
In addition to trading about million in goods and importing another . million in the fiscal year Canada provided million for development assistance in Burkina Faso that same year.
Ogho Ikhalo of Plan Canada an international development organization that has been working for decades with children in Burkina Faso said all staff in the country were safe.
We are saddened by the loss of lives specifically Canadians and also all the lives that were impacted by the situation she said. From our organizations standpoint we want all parties in the dispute to end the conflict and to ensure that all children are safe.

German officials arrested three Syrian citizens on Thursday in the German city of Dsseldorf. Adam BerryGetty Images
Germany has arrested three Syrian citizens on suspicion of plotting an Islamic State group terror attack.
The group allegedly had planned to carry out an attack in the city of Dsseldorf according to The Wall Street Journal and the three arrests occurred in three different German states on Thursday. 
There are no indications that the accused had already concretely begun carrying out their attack plan Germanys top prosecutor said according to the Journal.
The arrests occurred on the heels of a fourth member of the group turning himself into French authorities in February the prosecutor said. 
Two of the arrested Syrian citizens identified as males Saleh A. and Hamza C. reportedly joined the Islamic State group in Syria in early and were ordered to carry out an attack in Dsseldorf the capital of Germanys North RhineWestphalia state.
The two planned to attack one of the citys main streets with two suicide bombings and then to kill as many passersby as possible with guns and further explosives according to the prosecutor. 
The suspects reportedly traveled to Turkey and then to Germany via Greece common thoroughfares for refugees fleeing Middle Eastern violence. However the prosecutor declined to discuss whether the two suspects posed as refugees the Journal said.
Two other Syrians identified as Mahood B. and Abd Arahman A.K. were allegedly part of the group as well. On Feb. Saleh A. turned himself into Parisian authorities and continues to be detained in France the Journal reported.
The circumstances of the arrests may give fodder to critics of accommodating Western policies toward Middle Eastern refugees.
Germany last year hosted more than million people seeking asylum many from violence in the Middle East but not without considerable controversy. 
In the United States presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for a temporary shutdown of all Muslim immigration due to concerns about Islamic terrorism.

Two peoplehavebeen killed and one other person wasinjured in a stabbing attack at a synagogue in south Tel Aviv.
The two victims were later identified as Yisayev Aharon a yearold from Holon and Reuven Aviram a yearold from Ramle.
The injured victim a man in his sis in moderate condition. He wastreated at the scene byMagen David Adom paramedicsbefore being evacuated to Ichilov hospital.
The Arab terrorist who carried out the attackwas tackled and held by a civilian until police arrived to arrest him andsustained light injuries in the course of being captured.
He has been identified as a yearold resident of Dura close to Hevron with no previous criminal record and was given a legal work permitto bein Tel Aviv following security checks he worked at a restaurant in Yafo a suburb ofTel Aviv to the south.
The attack took placeat a synagogue inthe Panorama building along Ben Tzvi Streetin southern Tel Aviv as afternoon prayers were being conducted.
Security forces scrambled to the scene initially responded to reports of a possible second terrorist by conducting a sweep of the area but have confirmed that at this point those claims appear to have been mistaken.
MDA paramedics Moshe Danenberg and Younis Niniv recounted the disturbingscene they encountered.
The sight was difficult. At the entrance to one of the businesses in the building a yearold man was lying on the ground unconscious without a pulse and not breathing after suffering from stab wounds to his upper body.
Close to him lay a yearold man with stab wounds to his upper body and a floor below we located an additional casualty a man of about fully conscious.
We quickly provided them with first aid at the scene and immediately evacuated them to Ichilov hospital.
Deputy Defense Minister Rabbi Eli BenDahan responded to the attack shortly afterwards noting that it took place just a day after the first anniversary of the bloody terrorist attack at a Jerusalem synagogue which killed five people.
Just yesterday we marked one year since the despicable massacre at a synagogue in the Har Nof neighborhood of Jerusalem a year in which terror has hit us without mercy and now another despicable attack has occurred this time at a synagogue in Tel Aviv BenDahan said.
Terror is terror and it doesnt matter where it occurs he continued hinting at the recent terrorist attacks in Europe. In Israels case its roots are the incitement from the Palestinian leadership which encourages violence.
Only by continuing to act with a firm hand against terrorists and their supporters could Israel hope to combat the ongoing wave of terrorism he added.
Only destroying the homes of the terrorists swiftly after an attack and expelling their families will deter the next perpetrator.

Earlier inGush Etzion just north of Hevron three Arab women were detained after attempting to infiltrate an army base armed with knives.
In the wake of the terrorist attack on the offices of French satirist paper Charlie Hebdo one Muslim cleric justified the murders under Islamic law.
French citizens gather in Paris to denounce the terrorist attack against magazine Charlie Hebdo and to rally in defense of free speech. AP
Muslims consider the honor of the Prophet Muhammad to be dearer to them than that of their parents or even themselves. To defend it is considered to be an obligation upon them. The strict punishment if found guilty of this crime under sharia Islamic law is capital punishment implementable by an Islamic State. This is because the Messenger Muhammad said Whoever insults a Prophet kill him.
However because the honor of the Prophet is something which all Muslims want to defend many will take the law into their own hands as we often see.
The contention that mass murder is in any way an appropriate response to being personally offended is a dangerous slope on which to tread. There is no doubt that some of these cartoons can be seen as offensive to certain people but that same sentiment can be asserted on nearly any form of speech especially in politics. Hence the reasoning behind and the sanctity of the Constitutions first amendment.
So why in this case did the French government allow the magazineCharlie Hebdoto continue to provoke Muslims thereby placing the sanctity of its citizens at risk
This kind of blame shifting is also intellectually perilous. Placing the onus of speech on the any secular government is asking for abuse. But if Choudary had his way the government of the Islamic State would tightly control speech and punish transgressions with death.
Choudarys entire argument excusing the Paris attack reveals the fundamental disconnect between views of civilizations. Radical Islamists have no intention of assimilating into their respective cultures or contributing to any kind of meaningful dialogue about religion and free speech. They are intent on terrorizing western citizens out of exerting their rights. Their plan of terrorism and intimidation with the ultimate goal of imposing their religion on others is fundamentally antiAmerican and is not meant for the st century.

There were no confirmed claims of responsibility but the attacks come just a day after the United States announced a drone strike in Syria that likely killed Jihadi John the Islamic States Britishaccented executioner.
What were doing tonight is were applying an enhanced counterterrorism overlay said John Miller the NYPDs deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. That means we have no credible specific intelligence of any threat toward the city but out of an abundance of caution we provide deterrents but also reassurances to the public.
Cops late Friday began beefing up patrols at tourist areas including Times Square Penn Station and Barclays Center.
Both Mayor de Blasio and Gov. Cuomo issued statements condemning the attacks and vowing support and continued vigilance for any potential attacks in New York.
We are shocked by this new manifestation of maddening terrorist violence and hatred a Vatican spokesman said.
The attacks were carried out not far from the headquarters of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper where people were shot dead in January in an attack carried out by radicalized Islamic extremist brothers.
Four Jewish shoppers were also murdered in the same set of attacks inside a kosher supermarket in nearby Vincennes.
The French capital has been on a high state of alert ever since with security services warning that another attack was always likely.
In August a trio of Americans were able to tackle and detain a gunman before he carried out an attack on a train headed for Paris from Amsterdam.
At Bar Tabac in Brooklyn Thomas Caron watched in horror as the carnage unfolded in his home country.
Im still waiting to hear from friends and family back home Caron said. I cant imagine what the victims of the attacks are going through. It reminds me of . I was in Paris worried about friends in New York then. And now Im in New York worrying about loved ones in Paris. Its a terrible deja vu.

Im shocked and terribly saddened to have learnt about the awful tragedy which occurred yesterday at a football game in Iskandariya Iraq read a statement from Infantino.
Around the world football unites people. It is a very sad day when people going to a match together become the victims of such violence.
The bombing took place during a match in the small stadium in the city of Iskanderiyah miles kilometers from Baghdad the officials said. Medical officials confirmed the death toll. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.
The U.S. Embassy in Brussels is recommending that Americans in Belgium stay where they are and avoid public transportation.
And in Brussels the city center is often deserted as armed soldiers patrol tourist sites amid repeated government warnings that a terrorist attack is serious and imminent.
Some experts say it will take months for Europeans to psychologically adapt to life after the Paris attacks and warn that certain government measures intended to reassure people may backfire creating instead the impression of cities under siege.
The police barred media from publishing images of Yakub Abdul Razak Memons funeral apparently fearing a backlash against the execution that many said was driven by politics.
Executions are rare in India and in the last decade only two others have taken place both of terror convicts like Memon.
The earlier two executions were conducted in extreme secrecy and announced only after the fact. Their bodies were not handed to their families but were buried inside prison compounds.
French investigators were working to determine the recipients identity but werent able to immediately confirm media reports that it was an unspecified person now in Syria where the radical Islamic State group has seized territory the security officials said.
The revelation added a macabre twist to an investigation that has not turned up a solid link to radical or foreign groups but has revived concerns about terrorism in France less than six months after deadly attacks in the Paris area.
Tourists crowded into the airport at Hammamet near the coastal city of Sousse where a young man dressed in shorts on Friday pulled an assault rifle out of his beach umbrella and killed people mostly tourists.
The fight against terrorism is a national responsibility said a visibly exhausted Habib Essid at a press conference in Tunis early Saturday. We are at war against terrorism which represents a serious danger to national unity during this delicate period that the nation is going through.
The embassy released a statement Friday night urging Americans to report suspicious activities and stay away from any security incidents.
It also noted that French authorities have increased the terrorism alert level in recent months since attacks in January in Paris left victims and three Islamic attackers dead so there are more troops and police in the streets than in previous years.

A pair of gunmen killed at least people on a Tunisian beach Friday in the latest attack on the north African countrys key tourism industry the Interior Ministry said.
The governor of the Styria province Hermann Schuetzenhoefer gave the casualty figures and described the suspected driver as a yearold Austrian who was mentally disoriented and acting alone.
Police said the driver had been arrested. They said there were no indications of a terrorist attack and the suspect was apparently distressed over personal problems when he targeted his victims.

Preparing for a terrorist attack now provides you your best chance of survival in the event of an actual attack.
Devastating acts such as the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have left many concerned about the possibility of future incidents in the United States and their potential impact. They have raised uncertainty about what might happen next increasing stress levels. Nevertheless there are things you can do to prepare for the unexpected and reduce the stress that you may feel now and later should another emergency arise. Taking preparatory action can reassure you and your children that you can exert a measure of control even in the face of such events.
Finding out what can happen is the first step. Once you have determined the events possible and their potential in your community it is important that you discuss them with your family or household. Develop a disaster plan together.
Choose an outoftown contact your family or household will call or email to check on each other should a disaster occur. Your selected contact should live far enough away that they would be unlikely to be directly affected by the same event and they should know they are the chosen contact. Make sure every household member has that contacts and each others email addresses and telephone numbers home work pager and cell. Leave these contact numbers at your childrens schools if you have children and at your workplace. Your family should know that if telephones are not working they need to be patient and try again later or try email. Many people flood the telephone lines when emergencies happen but email can sometimes get through when calls dont.
Having a predetermined meeting place away from your home will save time and minimize confusion should your home be affected or the area evacuated. You may even want to make arrangements to stay with a family member or friend in case of an emergency. Be sure to include any pets in these plans since pets are not permitted in shelters and some hotels will not accept them.
If you need to evacuate your home or are asked to shelter in place having some essential supplies on hand will make you and your family more comfortable. Prepare a disaster supplies kit in an easytocarry container such as a duffel bag or small plastic trash can. Include special needs items for any member of your household infant formula or items for people with disabilities or older people first aid supplies including prescription medications a change of clothing for each household member a sleeping bag or bedroll for each a battery powered radio or television and extra batteries food bottled water and tools. It is also a good idea to include some cash and copies of important family documents birth certificates passports and licenses in your kit.
Copies of essential documentslike powers of attorney birth and marriage certificates insurance policies life insurance beneficiary designations and a copy of your willshould also be kept in a safe location outside your home. A safe deposit box or the home of a friend or family member who lives out of town is a good choice.
For more complete instructions ask your local Red Cross chapter for the brochure titled Your Family Disaster Supplies Kit
You need to know if they will they keep children at school until a parent or designated adult can pick them up or send them home on their own. Be sure that the school has updated information about how to reach parents and responsible caregivers to arrange for pickup. And ask what type of authorization the school may require to release a child to someone you designate if you are not able to pick up your child. During times of emergency the school telephones may be overwhelmed with calls.
For more information on putting together a disaster plan request a copy of the brochure titled Your Family Disaster Plan from your local American Red Cross chapter. You may also want to request a copy of Before Disaster Strikes . . . How to Make Sure Youre Financially Prepared for specific information on what you can do now to protect your assets.
If local authorities ask you to leave your home they have a good reason to make this request and you should heed the advice immediately. Listen to your radio or television and follow the instructions of local emergency officials and keep these simple tips in mind.
Devastating acts such as the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have left many concerned about the possibility of future incidents in the United States and their potential impact. They have raised uncertainty about what might happen next increasing stress levels. Nevertheless there are things you can do to prepare for the unexpected and reduce the stress that you may feel now and later should another emergency arise. Taking preparatory action can reassure you and your children that you can exert a measure of control even in the face of such events.If you are advised by local officials to shelter in place what they mean is for you to remain inside your home or office and protect yourself there. Close and lock all windows and exterior doors. Turn off all fans heating and air conditioning systems. Close the fireplace damper. Get your disaster supplies kit and make sure the radio is working. Go to an interior room without windows thats above ground level. In the case of a chemical threat an aboveground location is preferable because some chemicals are heavier than air and may seep into basements even if the windows are closed. Using duct tape seal all cracks around the door and any vents into the room. Keep listening to your radio or television until you are told all is safe or you are told to evacuate. Local officials may call for evacuation in specific areas at greatest risk in your community.
Raw unedited footage of terrorism events and peoples reaction to those events can be very upsetting especially to children. We do not recommend that children watch television news reports about such events especially if the news reports show images over and over again about the same incident. Young children do not realize that it is repeated video footage and think the event is happening again and again. Adults may also need to give themselves a break from watching disturbing footage. However listening to local radio and television reports will provide you with the most accurate information from responsible governmental authorities on whats happening and what actions you will need to take. So you may want to make some arrangements to take turns listening to the news with other adult members of your household.
Another useful preparation includes learning some basic first aid. To enroll in a first aid and AEDCPR course contact your local American Red Cross chapter. In an emergency situation you need to tend to your own wellbeing first and then consider first aid for others immediately around you including possibly assisting injured people to evacuate a building if necessary.
People who may have come into contact with a biological or chemical agent may need to go through a decontamination procedure and receive medical attention. Listen to the advice of local officials on the radio or television to determine what steps you will need to take to protect yourself and your family. As emergency services will likely be overwhelmed only call about lifethreatening emergencies.
Late on Saturday the evening after the terrorist attacks a group of friends gathered at an eccentric dive bar Stollys on the edge of the Marais. Its just the sort of small hip place that exists all over the Eleventh Arrondisement and had been targeted the night before. The friends were in their early twenties an international boho clan. Zorro with hair to his waist and skinny black trousers is studying Arabic at the Sorbonne and works as a bartender at Stollys sister bar the Lizard Lounge around the corner. He came with Ilona whos Polish and works with him. At the Lizard Lounge there had hardly been any customers and it closed early. They introduced me to Murat a Turkish Kurd who was pleased to be congratulated on the battle for Sinjar a Nepalese guy named Satcheen and Gabriel handsome and weary who sat down with a beer and said I knew they were gunshots because Im half Brazilian and I grew up in Rio. Ive heard gunshots but not so loud not so close. So when I first heard it I thought it was gang violence a drug issue. Most of the people knew betterone said No its Charlie all over again. 
The group started talking about the previous night. Gabriel had been working only for the second time at Le Marilou a bar tucked a block or two away from the trendy Canal SaintMartin stretch. There were twenty or thirty people at the bar a few at the tables outside.
Le Marilou is only twenty metres from the intersection where Le Petit Cambodge a popular Cambodian restaurant and Le Carillon a bar with draft beer face each other. One of the jihadi groups opened fire on both places killing fourteen people.
Everyone stood up Gabriel said. We filed all the people behind the bar. Theres a door there that goes out onto the courtyard like a well at the center of the building with a spiral staircase. We got everyone back there the ones outside too and people on the street. We waited. It was very calm. No one said anything. I went back into the bar with my boss and another coworker. One of the candles on the tables had set a napkin on fire so the table looked as if it was on fire. It was absurd. The shots were identifiable. But the fire was just an abstract idea. We pulled down the metal grille. We called the police they said they were on their way. We moved the tables and chairs to one side. We were cleaning up. I dont know whyit wasnt rationalbut it was something to occupy our minds. We were waiting about twenty minutes. Then the fire brigade came and police and ambulances. I went outside there were twenty bodies on the ground. The people who died had mostly been sitting at tables outside. They were beginning to cover them up. I saw them as silhouettes. A torso. Feet. One guy was lying in the street next to a car a bit farther awaymaybe twenty metres as if he had tried to run.
The police told Gabriel and the others that they couldnt leave. They turned the radio on for news. Everyone began calling and texting friends and family and scrolling through Twitter. Gabriel called Zorro and said Where are you Dont go out. Keep everyone insidetheres shooting. Everything was confused and there were rumorsthat someone was killed at the Bastille that something had happened at the Louvrethat turned out not to be true. Then they heard there were bombs at the soccer stadium and they realized that there had been multiple attacks that they were cordinated. Gabriels boss buckled over and kept saying Quelle horreur quelle horreur quelle horreur.
There was no time to imagine anything. It was frantic but at the same time very focussed very tense he said.
For a couple hours everyone managed to reach loved ones and then started to wonder when it would be possible to leave. The police told bargoers that they were inside a perimeter they could not leave unless they had cars parked inside it. Most of the customers were local and the people living upstairs from the bar offered to take the others in for the night. Gabriel slept on his bosss sofa.
At the Stolly we drank to Paris to alcohol and to the freedom to drink. There were about twenty people in the bar and everyone knew each other and clapped each other on the back embraced. There was some laughtereveryone was together. The atmosphere was wry and defiant.
I always tell people who have become victims of terrorism that they have to start from a new position the impact is so strong Guillaume said to me. It is a complete rupture. There is a life before and a life afterward. Its like when a billiard ball hits anotherlife goes off at a completely different angle.
Denoix de Saint Marc is gray now but he has come to see his recovery as linked to his activity. He was part of an association for relatives of the victims that campaigned and petitioned the French government to investigate the crash. Eventually in six Libyans including Abdullah Senussi Muammar Qaddafis chief of intelligence were convicted in absentia of the bombing in a Paris court. The plane was said to have been targeted in retaliation for French support of the Chadian government against Libyan expansionism. Not content Denoix de Saint Marc confronted Saif Qaddafi on a visit to Paris and became a chief negotiator for compensation for the victims of Flight . His efforts dovetailed with the negotiations over LockerbieLibya wanted to come in from the cold of international isolationand in the country agreed to pay a hundred and seventy million dollars to the victims families.
It took several years to track down each of the heirsthe victims had come from seventeen nations. There were plenty of fraudulent claims. But eventually all the funds were distributed. When it was done Denoix de Saint Marc set up the AfVT.
Before Friday the group had represented and helped about two thousand victims of terrorism. Among them are people from both sides of the Algerian war of independence a woman who was eight when she lost her arm in the famous Milk Bar bombing in Algiers in former hostages of the FARC in Colombia and several people who were caught in the attacks on Charlie Hebdo on January th and in the siege of the Hypercacher supermarket two days later. The organization tries to take politics out of terrorism and treat the latter as a universal trauma no matter the aims justifications and other circumstances.
Terrorism is completely different to other grief Denoix de Saint Marc told me. You dont have the same vision the same ideas anymore about the police the world your own government. You can become obsessed by geopolitics about issues that you never would have noticed before. Suddenly you become an expert on judicial legalities or a whole new region in the world. The question is always why Who Why me And then every time there is a new terrorist attack it brings everything back again.
Over the weekend Denoix de Saint Marc had been busy. Journalists called to try to get access to survivors. Survivors and their families called looking for help. Volunteers called to offer their services. On Sunday afternoon he fielded inquiries from CNN and conducted three TV interviews. A relative of a victim of the killing at the Bataclan theatre called because his niece had been left an orphan and he wanted to know what would be the best thing to do for her. A psychiatrist specializing in trauma called to see how she could help. At oclock he left to meet three people who had been in the Bataclan and seen their friends killed next to them.
Denoix de Saint Marc has come to understand that there are different stages of trauma and that recovery does not happen in a straight line. The first thing that often happens is that couples break up. Often one person is overwhelmed and passive and the other is running around full of agency and focussed on practicalitiesbut then in time the roles switch only to reverse again a few months later.
Terrorism affects the way you see the world the way you are in the world Denoix de Saint Marc said. It destroys comfort identity the idea of a safe home and all of the assumptions we usually carry around with us. It affects peoples beliefs.
As victims we are used as a weapon to hit a society. If society then forgets if society stops wanting to hear our stories to take care of usits not about empathy and compassion. Its about acknowledgement respect. We want people to understand that what happened to us can happen to anyone. That we suffered for the society.
Denoix de Saint Marc would like to take a step back from his role. Terrorism is relentless. Last year there were ten attacks either on French soil or involving French people abroad. This year after the Charlie Hebdo attack he had a burnout as he called it and had to stop working for several months.
On Friday evening he was watching a film on TV at home when he heard that there had been shootings in Paris. I asked if this attack was different. No its the same he said. Only the number of victims is different. When I hear them talk its exactly the same story I had before them.

Four people were killed in a terror attack at a synagogue in a Jerusalem neighborhood Tuesday morning.
Police said two attackers from East Jerusalem entered the synagogue in the Har Nof neighborhood at a.m. and began attacking worshipers at morning prayers with a gun a meat cleaver and an ax.
Israel Police said there were six injured including two policemen one of whom was seriously injured and another moderately hurt.
Amanwho prays at the synagogue told The Times of Israel that one of the victims was American and another British. That report was not immediately confirmed.
The attack occurred atthe Kehilat Yaakov synagogue located in a religious institution which includes a study hall.
One of the worshipers said the two terrorists shouted Allahu Akbar during the attack and entered the synagogue without their faces covered.
Photos taken from inside the synagogue after the attack showed bloodied male worshipers lying on the floor still wrapped in their prayer shawls and phylacteries.
I tried to escape. The man with the knife approached me. There was a chair and table between us my prayer shawl got caught. I left it there and escaped Yossi who was praying at the synagogue at the time of the attack told Channel TV. He declined to give his last name.
I heard shooting and one of the worshipers came out covered in blood and shouted Theres a massacre he said.
A videoshot by a bystander shows police engaged in a shootout with the attackers.
Both terrorists were from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber Channel reported. Clashes between residents and security forces broke out in the neighborhood.
According to Israel Radios Gal Berger Palestinian sources said the attackers were cousins named Said Abu Jamal and Uday Warsan.
Initial reports indicated the two were affiliated with the MarxistLeninist terrorist group Peoples Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
Hamas and Islamic Jihad hailed the attack saying it was in reaction to the death of a Palestinian bus driver.
In a statement the Islamist Hamas movement which dominates Gaza said it was a response to the murder of the martyr Yusuf Ramouni. It was referring to the bus driver from East Jerusalem who was found hanged inside his vehicle late on Sunday. Palestinian media claimed he was murdered an autopsy established that he committed suicide.
One of the terrorists worked in a corner store near the synagogue Channel reported.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening security consultations around noon his office said.
This is the direct result of the incitement led by Hamas and Abu Mazen he said referring to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Incitement that the international community irresponsibly ignores.
We will respond with a strong hand to the cruel murder of Jews who came to pray and were caught by dark murderous hands promised Netanyahu.
Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon called an emergency meeting in the wake of the attack.
Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch and Israel Police Commissioner Yohanan Danino arrived at the scene and were heckled by bystanders who yelled Go home
Aharonovitch described the attack as part of a new wave of terrorism by lone attackers and promised that the security forces would do their utmost to thwart it.
Crowds at the scene shouted out psalms while others chanted Death to terrorists
The ultraOrthodox Har Nof neighborhood where the attack occurred sits at the Western edge of Jerusalem and has been mostly shielded from the violencethat has wracked the city in recent weeks.
The attack came a day after tensions in Jerusalem once again ramped up in the wake of Ramounis suicide Sunday night. The drivers family claimed he had been killed by Jewish extremists setting off riots and strikes in the capital Monday.

In what appears to be the deadliest terror attacks in France in many decades at least people were feared killed in Paris on Friday night as a series of deadly attacks was staged across the capital city. Some reports say another were injured as many as seriously.
President Franois Hollande declared a state of emergency after an unknown number of gunmen opened fire in the crowded eastern part of the capital stormed a Bataclan concert hall during a packed music performance and set off explosives at the French national stadium the Stade de France which was filled to capacity for a FranceGermany soccer gameincluding with Hollande who was among the spectators. A Paris prosecutor said more than people are believed to have lost their lives. The head of Paris police said all attackers were believed to be dead.
Shortly before midnight Hollande went on television to appeal for calm and announce his government had shut French bordersa highly unusual move for European Union countries. We have to be compassionate and we have to be united and keep a cool head. France needs to be strong and the state needs to be strong he said. What the terrorists want is for us to be scared. There are things to be scared about. But in the face of terror we have to be united and we will defeat these terrorists.
Emergency medics at all hospitals across Paris were called into work shortly before midnight as the wide scale of casualties became apparent. All police leave was canceled. As the news of the attacks whipped through the city Parisian taxis switched off their meters on Friday night to ferry people home safely at no cost. Police appealed to people to keep off the streets on a night when Parisians typically crowd into bars and restaurants to kick off the weekend.
Since January when jihadists claiming allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria ISIS and to alQaeda in the Islamic Maghreb launched a massacre at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine and laid siege to a kosher supermarket the capital has been on high alert. Early details suggest that Friday nights attacks were far more sophisticatedand more deadlythan those back in January which involved three gunmen and killed people.
Parisians have remained highly jittery since the Charlie Hebdo attacks continually reminded that terror threats remain. There are the bag searches at the doors of major department stores and public buildings and uniformed soldiers with semiautomatic weapons patrol train stations and major intersections in the capital. All public buildings including schools have had red triangles posted on their front doors since January denoting the highest state of alert in the country. And just last August three Americans helped to thwart an armed attack on a packed highspeed train from Brussels to Paris when they wrestled a gunmen to the ground in the passage of the train car.
Worse still the capital is just two weeks away from hosting its biggest event in many yearsthe international negotiations of climate change which opens on Nov. with a gathering of dozens of world leaders including President Barack Obama.
Hundreds of people scrambled on to the field. One of the spectators Richard MBarki told BFM Television by phone shortly after that he had heard three explosions. There were not many policemen he said on air. People were badly informed.
Hollandes residence said that a Defence Council meeting is convening Saturday morning while the AP reports that the leader has cancelled his trip to the G

In addition Frances enforcement of radical secularism referred to as la laicit has led to a clash of cultural traditions and understandings of human rights. 
La laicit challenges some of the Muslim populations desire to publicly practice their faith. For example France was the first country in Europe to pass a ban on the fullface veil in public. 
The New York Times article Beirut Also the Site of Deadly Attacks Feels Forgotten addresses the disparity in media coverage of the attacks in Paris given other recent attacks in Beirut Lebanon which happened one day prior. ISIS claimed responsibility for the Beirut attacks which killed people and wounded . Similar criticism has also arisen for the failure to adequately cover attacks in Baghdad Iraq this weekend as well as events in the past. 
The BBC article Millions are sharing attack stories that arent about Paris explains how controversy about media coverage has resulted in people highlighting other events on social media and how this has caused confusion.

Roger D. Petersen takes a different view from Olivier Roy. In his article In Syria Politics Can Be More Effective Than Military Action he argues that events in Paris change the politics and make possible the critical but messy alliances necessary to eliminate ISIS.
Some people believe that the United States should not accept any asylum seekers from Syria arguing that events in France have proven the risk in doing so. An article from Reuters U.S. Republicans seek to shut door on Syrian refugees after Paris explores how some politicians aim to reject refugees seeking asylum. Some European government officials have similar fears as explained by Attackers Possible Link to Migrant Trail Heightens Security Fears from the New York Times.

Recent terror attacks in California and Paris have all of us talking about security in public places but there is one vulnerable target in Boston and throughout the Northeast that is potentially being overlooked.
Its just before sunrise at South Station and already theres a reminder of the threat of terrorism.
Armed Homeland Security Police officers are in the station making an unannounced inspection.
They are part of a Transportation Security Administration VIPR team which stands for Visual Intermodal Prevention and Response and they are working with Amtrak Police and their bomb sniffing dogs looking for suspicious behavior and explosives. Each officer is carrying a radiation detector.
This periodic security operation which takes place unannounced at train stations all over New England and the rest of country raises an important question.
How likely is it that there will be a terrorist attack here in the U.S. on a train
We have to expect it. Thats the bottom line said Sean Burke head of the Center for Resilience Studies at Northeastern University and a former Homeland Security official.
Train attacks are happening overseas and Burke said there is nothing in place to guarantee it wont happen here.
The passenger rail system is designed to be open Burke said. Its specifically put in densely populated areas. Its a system that is vulnerable really from the beginning of its trip to the end of its trip.
There is open access to the station everywhere you look. There are no check points security lines or baggage checks like there are in airports. And passengers dont even have to present identification before they board just a ticket.
The entire Amtrak system encompasses more than miles of unprotected tracks and the rail line between Boston and Washington DC the Northeast Corridor carries the majority of Amtraks passengers.
That is the heart and soul or our rail system in the U.S. said Congressman Stephen Lynch DMA who has studied many of the terrorist attacks on trains around the world since .
If the terrorists were trying to disrupt and quote terrorize that would be a prime target of those individuals Lynch said. When you see there are rail attacks in France or Russia or Japan or Spain or Britain that should be a message to us.It is estimated that five times as many people ride the rail system as fly in airplanes every year nationwide and experts say if you tried to install airport style security and screening in train stations it would bring the entire rail system to a screeching halt.
A Inspector Generals report criticized how Amtrak and the Department of Homeland Security were spending security money concluding the traveling public remains at risk for a potential terrorist attack at Amtraks highrisk stations.
We need our security officials to be frank about the issue that the Department of Homeland Security our first responders theyre not always going to be able to keep us safe said Burke.
Like on the train in France this past summer when it took the courageous acts of three American passengers to subdue an armed terrorist.
They are the first line of defense Burke said. It is every day citizens who are inevitably going to be the first responders.
A spokeswoman for Amtrak Police said the agency has partnerships with dozens of law enforcement agencies around the country and even employs two of its own intelligence analysts to assess and help respond to terrorist threats.
In addition Burke told us that private companies are in the process of developing new technologies to scan trains for explosives and chemicals before they are boarded.
Congressman Lynch is planning to host a rail security summit early next year the details of which are still being worked out.

On social media some fear a California terrorist attack is in progress. Police say the San Bernardino attack was perpetrated by at least one or more heavily armored shooters using AK type weapons and wearing militarystyle garb. The perpetrators may have planted a bomb within the Inland Regional Center an office building which provides services for those with developmental disabilities such as autism. Authorities have refused to speculate on the identity of the shooters but already some on social media fear it may be ISIS or DAESH.
UPDATE for December U.S. officials say that the two shooting suspects pledged allegiance to ISIS during the middle of the attack.
UPDATE At least two of the shooting suspects are down after engaging in gun battle with SWAT teams. A third suspect is still on the run as of this update.
In a related report by the Inquisitr fears over the threat of ISIS attacks in America has many in the United States questioning whether it is wise to allow tens of thousands of Muslim Syrian refugees into the country but the issue is complicated by the fact that ISIS alQaeda and other Islamic groups may follow the doctrine of AlTaqiyya or AlTaqiyah where the Prophet Mohammed commanded his followers to lie about their motivations in order to conquer enemy countries.
Already the fears related to Islamic terrorist groups have caused some on social media to claim the still active California shooting to be a terrorist attack by ISIS.
Would ISIS hit a clinic for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino California
According to ValueWalk law enforcement has refused to speculate at this time on the actual identities of the gunmen or gunman but they claim that given the scale of the shooting and that there are at least three shooters with long guns it seems that we might be dealing with a terrorist incident on U.S. soil this time. A bomb squad was sent to investigate a suspicious device left inside the Inland Regional Center and Value Walk reports that the possible explosive device has also been found and is being defused with CNN reporting that a robot is being sent in.
According to Sky News San Bernardino Sheriffs Office Spokeswoman Teri Adams said witnesses saw the suspects target an office Christmas party in the conference room. The California shooting suspects were apparently spotted changing clothes near the scene of the crime and they were wearing military gear. It is believed that up to three men fled in a black SUV and so far no arrests have been made.
One suspect is named Farooq Saeed and Inland Regional Center witnesses claim the man was acting strangely before the shooting began. San Bernardino police also say there is no proof at this time that the San Bernardino mass shooting is linked to an ISIS terrorism attack but the FBI says there is uncertainty at this time.
At this point I know one of your questions is going to be Is this a terrorist incident I will tell you right now we do not know if this is a terrorist incident said David Bowdich an assistant director for Los Angeles FBIs office according to CNN.
According to The Epoch Times FBI Assistant Director Ron Hosko also predicted the suspects are probably antigovernment or militia types.
Witness Marie Henning who hid in an office nearby to the California shooting described the scene.
I heard a helicopter circling over the office and shortly after our boulevard was completely filled with police vehicles unmarked cars she said. The Swat team was out in front of our office area putting on their protective gear.
The number of victims in the California attack is uncertain but Reuters reports that the Loma Linda University Medical Center said it had received four adult patients and was expecting three more. The San Bernardino Fire Department also said it was responding to reports of victims and witnesses have described seeing bodies on the floor of the office building. NDTV quotes the police as saying that at least people were killed and were injured in the California shooting.
While no one has claimed responsibility for the California attack in recent times ISIS has directly threatened to attack multiple states within the United States including California within six months.
We have trained soldiers in different states ready at our word to attack any target we desire. Out of the trained soldiers have signed up for missions like Sunday We are increasing in number bithnillah if God wills. Of the states we will name Virginia Maryland Illinois California and MichiganThe next six months will be interesting.
According to Breitbart most experts believe the figure is inaccurate and that the threat is only inspired by ISIS not directly linked to the group but they claimed these experts did not dismiss the possibility that some trained soldiers linked to ISIS are operating in the country.
In November of Michael Morell the former Acting Director and Deputy Director of the CIA wrote an editorial for Time magazine where he stated that ISIS will strike America.
ISIS poses a major threat to the US and to US interests abroad and that threat is growing every day. The FBI has over open investigations into homegrown extremists the vast majority radicalized by ISIS and a large number of which relate to individuals who may be plotting attacks here wrote Morell. Such attacks have already occurred in the US. Others have been arrested before they could act.
The current CIA Director John Brennan does believe that ISIS has more terrorist attacks in the pipeline but he claims the threat is greater in Europe than it is to the United States. The report from CNN also states that the number of ISIS members in the U.S. is estimated to be around people although another report says that at least Americans who actively support ISIS on social media and spread propaganda on the terror groups behalf with Twitter being the preferred platform. In California ISIS member Nicholas Michael Teausant was arrested in and according to The Jerusalem Post he recently plead guilty to providing material support to the Islamic State.

Terrorist attacks like the ones we experienced on September have left many concerned about the possibility of future incidents of terrorism in the United States and their potential impact. They have raised uncertainty about what might happen next increasing stress levels. There are things you can do to prepare for terrorist attacks and reduce the stress that you may feel now and later should another emergency arise. Taking preparatory action can reassure you and your children that you can exert a measure of control even in the face of such events.
Finding out what can happen is the first step. Once you have determined the events possible and their potential in your community it is important that you discuss them with your family or household. Develop a disaster plan together.
Choose an outoftown contact your family or household will call or email to check on each other should a disaster occur. Your selected contact should live far enough away that they would be unlikely to be directly affected by the same event and they should know they are the chosen contact. Make sure every household member has that contacts and each others email addresses and telephone numbers home work pager and cell. Leave these contact numbers at your childrens schools if you have children and at your workplace. 
If you need to evacuate your home or are asked to shelter in place having some essential supplies on hand will make you and your family more comfortable. Prepare a disaster supplies kit in an easytocarry container such as a duffel bag or small plastic trash can. Include special needs items for any member of your household infant formula or items for people with disabilities or older people first aid supplies including prescription medications a change of clothing for each household member a sleeping bag or bedroll for each a batterypowered radio or television and extra batteries food bottled water and tools. It is also a good idea to include some cash and copies of important family documents birth certificates passports and licenses in your kit.
Copies of essential documentslike powers of attorney birth and marriage certificates insurance policies life insurance beneficiary designations and a copy of your willshould also be kept in a safe location outside your home. A safe deposit box or the home of a friend or family member who lives out of town is a good choice.
Your local authorities will provide you with the most accurate information specific to an event in your area. Staying tuned to local radio and television and following their instructions is your safest choice.
Raw unedited footage of terrorism events and peoples reaction to those events can be very upsetting especially to children. We do not recommend that children watch television news reports about such events especially if the news reports show images over and over again about the same incident. Young children do not realize that it is repeated video footage and think the event is happening again and again. Adults may also need to give themselves a break from watching disturbing footage. However listening to local radio and television reports will provide you with the most accurate information from responsible governmental authorities on whats happening and what actions you will need to take. So you may want to make some arrangements to take turns listening to the news with other adult members of your household.
MOBILE phone footage from a concertgoer in the Bataclan theatre has captured the moment the first gunshots were fired unleashing the bloodiest of several massacres across Paris on Friday night. 
Seb Snow was among fans of Californian rock band Eagles of Death Metal inside the theatre when the concert was interrupted by the sound of bullets.
In the short clip band members appear startled and confused when their playing is drowned out by the sudden and loud clap of bullets being fired from somewhere in the packed auditorium.
The concert hall was the scene of one of several terror attacks across Paris on Friday night local time when people were killed in total of whom were attending the show at the Bataclan.
In other dramatic footage to surface since the attack French police can be seen in a tense shootout with the attackers.
The video taken by witness Patrick Zachmann shows police and the terrorists in a standoff outside the Bataclan theatre.
The officers are seen shooting at the terrorists before taking refuge from the spray of bullets outside the venue surrounded by emergency vehicles.
Zachmann a photographer narrated the video as he was filming saying he saw a woman asking for help she was saying aidezmoi aidezmoi so help me help me Daily Mail reported.
Six attackers blew themselves up one shot by police and detonated his explosive vest reports of eighth attacker not confirmed
Attackers thought to multinational team with links to the Middle East Belgium and possibly Germany as well as homegrown French roots
Police say attackers appeared to be seasoned at first sight and well trained
Police have identified one gunman who blew himself up at the Bataclan concert hall as yearold Paris native Omar Ismail Mostefai he has never been linked to terrorism. His father and yearold brother have been taken into custody and their homes are being searched
Three people have been arrested in Belgium after a Belgian hired car found near one attack site
A man arrested in Germanys Bavaria state after guns and explosives found in his car may also be linked to attacks
The holder of Syrian passport found near the body of one suicide bomber outside the soccer stadium passed though the Greek island of Leros in October with refugees the Greek minister says
One of the seven men behind the killing of people in coordinated attacks in Paris has been identified as a onetime Algerianborn petty criminal who in the past five years became radicalized.
The identification of the yearold French citizen Omar Ismail Mostefai came as police in the French capital launched raids on several homes across the city and warned other attackers could be out there.
The fear of further extremists emerging came after a black Seat car believed to have been used in at least four of the French restaurants attacked including le Petit Cambodge and Le Carillon where people were killed has been found km east of the capital in Montreuil.
Police had been desperate to find the vehicle which was also suspected of having been used at the Rue de la Fontaine restaurant attacks where five people were killed including at the Casa Nostra and the restaurants on rue de Charonne where died.
Police have revealed however Mostefai was already known to security services because of his movement with other known extremists but his police record never went beyond juvenile petty criminal activities.
He was identified from fingerprints found on a finger discovered amid the bloody melee at the Bataclan concert hall. He had been wearing a suicide vest and detonated himself.
Yesterday his father brother and sisterinlaw and other relatives were arrested six people in all and were still being questioned this morning French time. Others are expected to be arrested today.
Its a crazy thing its madness the brother said moments before he was detained.
Belgium police meanwhile have also late today arrested another person suspected of being connected to the Paris rampage. That makes six people they are questioning.
French police have also revealed another suspect who had a ticket to attend the football friendly between France and Germany only detonated himself after being stopped by security at the entrance to the sports ground.
Police said had he entered the stadium the carnage would have been more significant at that site.
French police have identified three teams of gunmen wearing suicide vests who killed at least .
A yearold Frenchman was the first to be confirmed among the seven attackers all of whom died in the assault while two other men who registered as refugees in Greece have been linked to the atrocities.
The Greek line of inquiry and the discovery of at least one Syrian passport at the scene has raised suspicions some of the attackers or accomplices might have entered Europe as part of an influx of people fleeing Syrias civil war.
A Syrian passport in the name of a person born in Syria in September was found near a suicide bomber who blew himself up at the Stade de France stadium prosecutor Francois Molins told a press conference on Saturday.
President Francois Hollande called the coordinated assault on Friday night an act of war as the Paris capitals normally bustling streets fell eerily quiet.
A national emergency and three days of mourning have been declared. Paris City Hall ordered all city facilities closed while the Eiffel Tower shut indefinitely.
The remains of the yearold French gunman were found near the Bataclan concert hall in eastern Paris the bloodiest of the attacks.
The jihadists were heard raging at the French president and his decision in September to begin air strikes on Islamic State in Syria.
The investigation quickly spread beyond France on Saturday as Belgian police arrested several suspects in Brussels including one who was in Paris at the time of the carnage.
Michel told Belgian television that the arrests were linked to suspect vehicles identified during the investigation by French police.
French authorities also asked their Greek counterparts for information on the passport found at the scene of the Stade de France attack.
We confirm that the Syrian passport holder came through the Greek island of Leros on October where he was registered under EU rules said a statement issued by Greek minister for citizen protection Nikos Toskas.
Another foreigner sought in connection with the attacks was also found to have registered in Greece police sources confirmed. Greece is the main entry point in Europe for hundreds of thousands of Syrians refugees and European security forces have long feared that IS militants could hide among them.
In Germany the authorities said they were looking into a possible link between the attacks and the arrest in Bavaria last week of a man with a carload of weapons and explosives.
The Paris attacks were prepared organised and planned overseas with help from inside France Hollande said.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is in the closest contact with Australias security and counterterrorism officials on domestic threats after the deadly attacks in Paris. Despite being in Turkey for G meetings the prime minister is receiving regular briefings from the federal police commissioner director general of ASIO and his ministers.
Australian security forces are working with their French counterparts to assess risks and so far have provided no advice to raise the terrorthreat level.
Mr Turnbull pointed to other recent largescale attacks including recent bombings in Turkey and Beirut to highlight the global struggle with terrorism.
But he reassured Australians of his confidence in domestic security agencies heralding their collective ability to keep us safe.
We cant pretend the risk is not there but we have to recognise that the security agencies spend their days ensuring that these attacks do not occur he told ABC television on Sunday. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten confirmed his support for the governments national security measures saying both sides would work together to provide resources to antiterror agencies.
Today is a day where we remind everyone that if the terrorists hope they can divide us theyre not going to succeed in Australia he told reporters in Melbourne ahead of his own national security briefing on Sunday.

More than .m supporters including tens of thousands of British and Irish fans are expected to attend the continents flagship football event making the tournament a huge potential target for the Islamic terrorists.
Mohamed Abrini who was arrested following the bloody Belgian attacks earlier this month has now told police about the planned attack although prosecutors are refusing to reveal details.
Its extra proof of the very high threats to the whole of Europe and to France in particular 
Abrini a BelgianMoroccan national was one of six people arrested last week in connection with the Brussels attacks which left dead. He was also wanted in connection with the Paris attacks last November.
His fingerprints were found in two safe houses in Belgian linked to the terrorists and his warning is sure to worry authorities across Europe.
Abrinis open threat to the tournament will bring back chilling memories of last Novembers deadly attacks in Paris in which people were killed in a series of explosions and shootings including one at the Stade de France which is due to hold this summers highprofile final.
One innocent civilian was killed when three suicide bombers blew themselves up near the stadium on November while a friendly match was being played between France and Germany
The televised footage of footballers and fans responding with confusion to the sound of explosions chilled viewers and will be in the minds of organisers as they seek to protect fans this summer.
Ireland manager Martin ONeill has already admitted that proposals to play the tournament without any fans present may be necessary for the safety of the people.
Theres talk about matches being played behind closed doors but the safety of people is of paramount importance and anything that is agreed upon we will fall in line.
With the tournament now just two months away UEFA the European footballing body has not ruled out banning fans from matches altogether although currently they are focusing on more security checks around stadiums and a heavy police presence.

As the sun goes down in Europe support for Belgium is pouring in after Tuesdays deadly terror attacks in its capital.
The terror strike in Gurdaspur Punjab is a tactical error by Pakistan. It extends its sponsorship of terrorism beyond Jammu Kashmir to Punjab. Though Pakistan was deeply complicit in funding and arming Khalistani terrorists in Punjab in the s and early s it soon shifted its focus to the Valley.
In the Valley Pakistan hid behind the veil of the freedom fighter saying it was merely providing moral support to the Kashmiri cause in a disputed territory. Punjab is not disputed territory. The Gurdaspur attack exposes the Pakistani establishment as a state sponsor of terrorism based not on ideology but on pathological enmity with India.
Pacifists want to engage with Pakistan. Dialogue is the only way forward they say. Rajya Sabha MP Mani Shankar Aiyar continues to call for an uninterrupted and uninterruptible dialogue.
Such carte blanche emboldens a rogue state like Pakistan to launch terrorist attacks on India with impunity and then quickly disown them to pressurise India to resume talks on Pakistans terms.
Hawks on the other hand urge the government to launch crossborder raids on Pakistani territory to inflict damage on terror camps over such camps reportedly exist though in makeshift infrastructure.
The cowardly Gurdaspur attack by wellarmed and trained terrorists is an opportunity for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make a strong public statement on Pakistansponsored terrorism and take questions from the media. This is the time to assert his leadership. The statement must spell out the governments broad intent and strategy on Pakistan. It need not disclose details of any covert operations on Pakistani soil that may or may not be under planning.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to make a statement on the Gurdaspur terror attack in parliament on Tuesday. It must reflect strong intent not the mild remarks he initially made to the Press Trust of India PTI.
National Security Advisory NSA Ajit Doval is an old hand on Pakistansponsored terrorism. It is important he too make a supplementary statement to the PMs again without disclosing details of the strategy to counter Pakistani terrorism. 
Anything less than this will not help India bring to an end the undeclared war that Pakistan has been waging on our border for decades. Unless Pakistan is made to pay it will not stop.
Authorities investigating a shooting at an Orlando nightclub that left about people dead and more than wounded have classified the incident as a terrorist attack.
Officials said at a press conference which you can watch above that they have not yet determined if the shooting is a domestic attack or if there are ties to international terrorism. 
The shooting occurred at Pulse a gay nightclub in Orlando at about a.m. Sunday. The gunman who was armed with an assaulttype rifle a handgun and a device was killed by a SWAT team at about a.m. after police decided to storm the club to rescue about hostages. 
At this point this is an incident we can certainly classify as a domestic terror incident Orange County Sheriff Jeffrey Demings said at the press conference Sunday morning.
The investigation is now being led by the FBI. The gunman has been identified by CBS News as Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie Florida.
Local FBI Assistant Special AgentinCharge Ron Hopper said at the press conference that there are suggestions the gunman may have leanings toward Jihadist ideology. Hopper had been asked about whether the shooter was connected to radical Islamic terrorism.
Hopper said they cant say definitively whether the gunmen is connected to that ideology. He said were looking into all angles right now.
Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.
The FBI and local police say there is no indication of another threat to the Orlando community or anywhere else in the United States. There were no witnesses reports of a second gunman but investigators will be looking into whether anyone else was involved in the attack.
We have no credible threat or singular information to suggest that there is any further threat to Orlando or the surrounding area or anywhere else as it relates to this particular investigation Hopper said.
Demings said the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange Center has been activated to share information between local state and federal police agencies. 
We are not just looking at this from one perspective Hopper said. Every resource in the FBI will be brought to bear on this investigation.
Police have asked anyone with information about the shooting and the gunman to come forward.
If you have some information no matter how small you think it may be that would relate back to todays events please share it with us Hopper said. I would urge you to call the CALLFBI public access line we have phones standing by to take any information or lead whatsoever.
Hopper said they will be conducting interviews and a huge FBI presence will be seen in coming days.
Several people were shot at Pulse a gay nightclub in Orlando Florida. The gunman has been killed. Watch videos from the scene here.
This is exactly what President Obama wanted . This is the most clear false flag operation. It is clear from the type of weapon that was used in the fact that a bomb was also used. Obamas original mission was to allow as many Muslims in United States and then just say that we must take up all of guns because theyre all just unable to live in our society. Well I have news for Mr. Obama. We are not falling for your order idea that taking away our guns. You can go to hell.
You are clearly a delusion sister humping redneck that cannot resist am talk radio propaganda. You better hurry up and get yer marching orders for the day so youll know how to reply to everyone you ignorant fake patriot.
gay people now dead during the Islamic holy month. Islamic countries execute gays on a regular basisthats statesanctioned murder NOT ISIS or terror groups. Islam IS a terror group.
There is really no telling which type of idiot decided to do this. I for one agree with the obvious new practice of not giving these clowns the center stage. How about never utter the persons name for as long as humanly possible. Id rather that policy comes into being.
I agree totally. Obama was known as bathhouse Barry in Chicago. This is very interesting because liberals usually want to take up all the guns to protect children. Now we can see the plan. Obama wants to confiscate all guns to protect the homosexuals. You can bet that this was a Muslim I came into United States recently.
This was a conservative hatemonger who targeted gays. Of course our fake Christian conservatives and ISIS and A Qaeda have the exact same hate and evil thoughts . So for now we do not know if it is a Fox News TEA Party Terrorist like Dylan Roof of an ISIS wannabe same people they just fake worship different Gods.
The only difference between the selfproclaimed yet fake Christians and ILISDaesh is that our lunatics were born here or they too would yelling Allah Akbar.
If Ted Cruz and his ilk had been born in Afghanistan he would be a member of the original Tabiban. Same assholes same shit its just that Secular Liberalism influences the laws here so they cant get away with their extremism some of the times.
It was individual expression not protected by the st amendment. I will do my cheek dancing at officers clubs with real men. Xoxo one of the good ones
There is no evidence that this person was a conservative or targeting gays. Just because he shot up a gay nightclub doesnt mean he was targeting gays. He could have been a gay guy that didnt get enough play at the club and got mad and wanted to kill a bunch of regulars. And I havent heard anything about conservatism only one comment about him possibly being a Muslim tied to Islamic terrorism. Just keep making stuff up huh
Actually the bathhouse is unknown. I dont care if your gay or straight as I have many gay friends but the bathhouse has not proven false.
Another gun free zone were people shouldve been allowed to concealed carry. The government of Florida owns this.
This BS about the right to carry unregulated arms is a recent historical creation compliments of that evil shit Scalia.
I guess went you cant motivate your base by yelling out the Nword you have to find other methods of motivating the evil to show up at the polls on voting day.
If you knew anything about concealed carry you would know you cannot drink and carry. But ignorance about guns and defending oneself is the antigun premise.
It seems that way during events like this I think guns around hard alcohol would have a toll too over time.
Why are the police always showing up after these events. Let the citizens take care of things make concealed carry legal everywhere in the United States.
LOL what a sight it must of been to see hear all the limp wrist sissys scared out of their wits LOL
Of course it was a terror attack thats why they have not released the shooters name it must be muslim.
How am I not surprised by immediate claims Obama did this. Anything bad happens anywhere in the entire universe and suddenly Barack Obama is responsible.
If the FBI is serious about investigating this terrorism I can lend them my copy of The Most Holy Koran as Obama calls the Islamic War Manual
Fbi knows it everyone knows it . Its a common sense thing . Islam hates gay islam murders gay . Easy to understand
Regardless of your thoughts and beliefs on gays and lesbian you have to grieve for their loss from this senseless act. When will we wake up and make this country safe Why do these ethnic looking people have more rights to not being profiled than WE have to be safe If it walks like a duck quacks like a duck its a duck. You government do your job and protect me or give me the tools to protect myself.
When its a Muslim perpetrating radial Islamic terror they prefer to call it domestic terror or workplace violence and to keep the suspects name quiet for as long as possible.
So much for the BS that what stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
Here we go again Assuming a terrorist attack. If it was unclear then dont mention it I tell you the media is a joke. Oh yeah lets blame Obama plp are stupid right away blaming the president. some act of violence against gays HATE CRIME thats all and why we are selling assault rifles again in Walmarts so shit can happen like this only the south
Daily Mail other Euro websites are reporting that it is an ISISrelated event. Why cant I find any sites in the U.S. that are stating this instead of already making it a gun debate. Both parties colluded to allow as many refugeesinto this country as possible democrats AND Republicans at least the republican leadership.
Time to make this a debate about bringing people into this country that hate the majority of things that this nation just happens to stand for instead of sending them to sister ArabMuslim countries where they would understand the language and be in countries with likeminded Muslims. But then that isnt the plan is it The plan is to take our guns and use the Extremists as a means to accomplish this. neverhillary
Gunman must be a muslim . Its a islamic jihad terror attack . And Obama has to hide that it was muslim as he wants to call thousand muslim refuges from syria to settle and make citizen of this country who will make islamic terrorist acts in the whole country . And make this country worse than syria or iraq where daily bombings mass shootings will happen and make this country a third world country .Obama has to do it as he is one .
No one who subscribes to the teachings of the Koran or its derivatives can be trusted in any way. 
The Koran instructs them to lie and cheat to gain advantage over their enemies us and it does not matter to them if they take any oath of allegiance or claim to be peaceful their words are lies.
We will continue to pay for our misplaced trust in them with more deaths until we finally wake up and deal with them.
Islam teaches jihad . Means to kill all the nonfollowers of islam means followers of all other religion . They want one rule one religion in world Islam. Easy to understand . Obama wants to call thousand islamic refugees from Syria . Democrats want to make this country like syria or iraq without any law and order . This event was a hont . Whole pic is coming soon if democrats win
Our muslim president has allowed . million ILLEGALS into the country above and beyond the limits set by congress many of them are muslims who cannot be happy anywhere they settle islam is not a religion it is a cult started by a pedophile run by misogynistic men who abuse and kill women and mutilate children It time now to stop be OUTRAGED and vote ever one of these politically correct senators and congressmen the hell out of office.
Muslims do not like and hate Beerdressing shortwomen rightsPorkanything and everything non islamic nonmuslims So why come here Stay in your country why come here and disturb us we live the way we want if you do not like get out and stop not come here why dont you go to your oil rich muslim countries.You the so called Moderate muslims what are you doing nothingwe do not want to leave our country to our future generations the illegal emigrants jihadi fanatic muslims
I cant really care about this particular massacre. A gay club was attacked by a Jihadist they went out of their way to make themselves easy to slaughter. What really is a problem is the Gay Community has gone to great lengths in recent years to give everybody good reason to hate them. Even now they rush to cover up the Islamic Character of this attack trying to leverage it into Gun Control or blaming The Right.
After they kill all the gays and you didnt do anything about it then kill all the Jews and you dont do anything about it then kill all the Zoroastrians and you dont do anything about it then kill all the Buddhists and you dont do anything about it then kill all the Sikhs and you dont do anything about it and then kill all the Shinto and you dont do anything about it then finally come to kill you who will be left to help come to your defense
Not a terror crime possibly a hate crime but NRA and the alike will use this terrible incident as an argument of justification to be armed Oh see.. The terrorists are coming to kill us all
Terrible news we are waking up to. A terrorist attack leaving dead and wounded in Orlando FL at a gay night club by a muslim man who was on the FBI watch list with possible ties to terrorist organizations. Those are the facts. No spin no watering down just the facts as I understand them.Folks the truth is clearly before you without excuses. The news media is not advancing truth and honesty in our society. The news networks have deliberately ignored the oaths of journalism and decided to advance a political and social agenda that is disturbingly inaccurate and incomplete. Its message is inconsistent with what true journalism is. They are deliberately being vague with some details and dishonest with regards to what is completely understood information. This is blatant propaganda and the liberal agenda is deliberately broadcasting rhetoric to keep you willfully ignorant and emotionally stupid to question their content and makes you complacent to their primary intent andor motive Which is to keep you obedientQuestion everything the news organizations broadcast because they are not honest and its clearly visible
Yeah right it was an extensive plan created by NSA CIA and Special Ops using black stealth helicopters. Only those wearing foil hats can escape
Recent terror attacks in California and Paris have all of us talking about security in public places but there is one vulnerable target in Boston and throughout the Northeast that is potentially being overlooked.
Its just before sunrise at South Station and already theres a reminder of the threat of terrorism.
Armed Homeland Security Police officers are in the station making an unannounced inspection.
They are part of a Transportation Security Administration VIPR team which stands for Visual Intermodal Prevention and Response and they are working with Amtrak Police and their bomb sniffing dogs looking for suspicious behavior and explosives. Each officer is carrying a radiation detector.
This periodic security operation which takes place unannounced at train stations all over New England and the rest of country raises an important question.
How likely is it that there will be a terrorist attack here in the U.S. on a train
We have to expect it. Thats the bottom line said Sean Burke head of the Center for Resilience Studies at Northeastern University and a former Homeland Security official.
Train attacks are happening overseas and Burke said there is nothing in place to guarantee it wont happen here.
The passenger rail system is designed to be open Burke said. Its specifically put in densely populated areas. Its a system that is vulnerable really from the beginning of its trip to the end of its trip.
There is open access to the station everywhere you look. There are no check points security lines or baggage checks like there are in airports. And passengers dont even have to present identification before they board just a ticket.
The entire Amtrak system encompasses more than miles of unprotected tracks and the rail line between Boston and Washington DC the Northeast Corridor carries the majority of Amtraks passengers.
That is the heart and soul or our rail system in the U.S. said Congressman Stephen Lynch DMA who has studied many of the terrorist attacks on trains around the world since .
If the terrorists were trying to disrupt and quote terrorize that would be a prime target of those individuals Lynch said. When you see there are rail attacks in France or Russia or Japan or Spain or Britain that should be a message to us.It is estimated that five times as many people ride the rail system as fly in airplanes every year nationwide and experts say if you tried to install airport style security and screening in train stations it would bring the entire rail system to a screeching halt.
A Inspector Generals report criticized how Amtrak and the Department of Homeland Security were spending security money concluding the traveling public remains at risk for a potential terrorist attack at Amtraks highrisk stations.
We need our security officials to be frank about the issue that the Department of Homeland Security our first responders theyre not always going to be able to keep us safe said Burke.
Like on the train in France this past summer when it took the courageous acts of three American passengers to subdue an armed terrorist.
They are the first line of defense Burke said. It is every day citizens who are inevitably going to be the first responders.
A spokeswoman for Amtrak Police said the agency has partnerships with dozens of law enforcement agencies around the country and even employs two of its own intelligence analysts to assess and help respond to terrorist threats.
In addition Burke told us that private companies are in the process of developing new technologies to scan trains for explosives and chemicals before they are boarded.
Congressman Lynch is planning to host a rail security summit early next year the details of which are still being worked out.

He could have been a gay guy that didnt get enough play at the club and got mad and wanted to kill a bunch of regulars. And I havent heard anything about conservatism only one comment about him possibly being a Muslim tied to Islamic terrorism. Just keep making stuff up huh
Actually the bathhouse is unknown. I dont care if your gay or straight as I have many gay friends but the bathhouse has not proven false.
Another gun free zone were people shouldve been allowed to concealed carry. The government of Florida owns this.
This BS about the right to carry unregulated arms is a recent historical creation compliments of that evil shit Scalia.
I guess went you cant motivate your base by yelling out the Nword you have to find other methods of motivating the evil to show up at the polls on voting day.
If you knew anything about concealed carry you would know you cannot drink and carry. But ignorance about guns and defending oneself is the antigun premise.
It seems that way during events like this I think guns around hard alcohol would have a toll too over time.
Why are the police always showing up after these events. Let the citizens take care of things make concealed carry legal everywhere in the United States.
LOL what a sight it must of been to see hear all the limp wrist sissys scared out of their wits LOL
Of course it was a terror attack thats why they have not released the shooters name it must be muslim.
How am I not surprised by immediate claims Obama did this. Anything bad happens anywhere in the entire universe and suddenly Barack Obama is responsible.
If the FBI is serious about investigating this terrorism I can lend them my copy of The Most Holy Koran as Obama calls the Islamic War Manual
Fbi knows it everyone knows it . Its a common sense thing . Islam hates gay islam murders gay . Easy to understand
Regardless of your thoughts and beliefs on gays and lesbian you have to grieve for their loss from this senseless act. When will we wake up and make this country safe Why do these ethnic looking people have more rights to not being profiled than WE have to be safe If it walks like a duck quacks like a duck its a duck. You government do your job and protect me or give me the tools to protect myself.
When its a Muslim perpetrating radial Islamic terror they prefer to call it domestic terror or workplace violence and to keep the suspects name quiet for as long as possible.
So much for the BS that what stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
Here we go again Assuming a terrorist attack. If it was unclear then dont mention it I tell you the media is a joke. Oh yeah lets blame Obama plp are stupid right away blaming the president. some act of violence against gays HATE CRIME thats all and why we are selling assault rifles again in Walmarts so shit can happen like this only the south
Daily Mail other Euro websites are reporting that it is an ISISrelated event. Why cant I find any sites in the U.S. that are stating this instead of already making it a gun debate. Both parties colluded to allow as many refugeesinto this country as possible democrats AND Republicans at least the republican leadership.
Time to make this a debate about bringing people into this country that hate the majority of things that this nation just happens to stand for instead of sending them to sister ArabMuslim countries where they would understand the language and be in countries with likeminded Muslims. But then that isnt the plan is it The plan is to take our guns and use the Extremists as a means to accomplish this. neverhillary
Gunman must be a muslim . Its a islamic jihad terror attack . And Obama has to hide that it was muslim as he wants to call thousand muslim refuges from syria to settle and make citizen of this country who will make islamic terrorist acts in the whole country . And make this country worse than syria or iraq where daily bombings mass shootings will happen and make this country a third world country .Obama has to do it as he is one .
No one who subscribes to the teachings of the Koran or its derivatives can be trusted in any way. 
The Koran instructs them to lie and cheat to gain advantage over their enemies us and it does not matter to them if they take any oath of allegiance or claim to be peaceful their words are lies.
We will continue to pay for our misplaced trust in them with more deaths until we finally wake up and deal with them.
Islam teaches jihad . Means to kill all the nonfollowers of islam means followers of all other religion . They want one rule one religion in world Islam. Easy to understand . Obama wants to call thousand islamic refugees from Syria . Democrats want to make this country like syria or iraq without any law and order . This event was a hont . Whole pic is coming soon if democrats win
Our muslim president has allowed . million ILLEGALS into the country above and beyond the limits set by congress many of them are muslims who cannot be happy anywhere they settle islam is not a religion it is a cult started by a pedophile run by misogynistic men who abuse and kill women and mutilate children It time now to stop be OUTRAGED and vote ever one of these politically correct senators and congressmen the hell out of office.
Muslims do not like and hate Beerdressing shortwomen rightsPorkanything and everything non islamic nonmuslims So why come here Stay in your country why come here and disturb us we live the way we want if you do not like get out and stop not come here why dont you go to your oil rich muslim countries.You the so called Moderate muslims what are you doing nothingwe do not want to leave our country to our future generations the illegal emigrants jihadi fanatic muslims
I cant really care about this particular massacre. A gay club was attacked by a Jihadist they went out of their way to make themselves easy to slaughter. What really is a problem is the Gay Community has gone to great lengths in recent years to give everybody good reason to hate them. Even now they rush to cover up the Islamic Character of this attack trying to leverage it into Gun Control or blaming The Right.
After they kill all the gays and you didnt do anything about it then kill all the Jews and you dont do anything about it then kill all the Zoroastrians and you dont do anything about it then kill all the Buddhists and you dont do anything about it then kill all the Sikhs and you dont do anything about it and then kill all the Shinto and you dont do anything about it then finally come to kill you who will be left to help come to your defense
Not a terror crime possibly a hate crime but NRA and the alike will use this terrible incident as an argument of justification to be armed Oh see.. The terrorists are coming to kill us all
Terrible news we are waking up to. A terrorist attack leaving dead and wounded in Orlando FL at a gay night club by a muslim man who was on the FBI watch list with possible ties to terrorist organizations. Those are the facts. No spin no watering down just the facts as I understand them.Folks the truth is clearly before you without excuses. The news media is not advancing truth and honesty in our society. The news networks have deliberately ignored the oaths of journalism and decided to advance a political and social agenda that is disturbingly inaccurate and incomplete. Its message is inconsistent with what true journalism is. They are deliberately being vague with some details and dishonest with regards to what is completely understood information. This is blatant propaganda and the liberal agenda is deliberately broadcasting rhetoric to keep you willfully ignorant and emotionally stupid to question their content and makes you complacent to their primary intent andor motive Which is to keep you obedientQuestion everything the news organizations broadcast because they are not honest and its clearly visible
Yeah right it was an extensive plan created by NSA CIA and Special Ops using black stealth helicopters. Only those wearing foil hats can escape
A wave of terror is sweeping across one of the worlds great cities tonight as it appears as though terrorists are carrying out a coordinated multifaceted attack on Paris. Reports so far are scattered and information is emerging fast and furious but heres what we know so far.
Armed gunmen have taken hostages at a music venue in the city. Reports have put the number of hostages at around .
There was at least one explosion outside of a soccer stadium while a FranceGermany match was taking place. The president of France was rushed out of the stadium and taken to a secure location. Some reports have two explosions taking place possibly the work of suicide bombers.
MSNBC has someone on a phone reporting two suicide bombers detonated themselves outside the national stadium in Paris. A shootout elsewhere.
If in Paris stay the F away from canal side of La Rpublique area. A man w AK just gunned down multiple people on run. Yes Im okay
Early reports state that at least are dead in the attacks. An AP report put that number at . Paris has closed its borders and will be declaring a state of emergency.
Tom Steinfort of Channel Nine Australia relays a statement from a hostage who says the gunmen shouted about Syria.
A hostage who escaped the Paris theatre says the gunmen were yelling about Syria
CNN reports that ISIS is using the ParisInFlames hashtag to claim responsibility for these attacks. At this time the hashtag shows few current results so the report may not be accurate. In addition the Arabic translation of ParisOnFire only reveals antiISIS tweets.
Reuters updates the situation with another shooting this time at the Halles shopping mall in Paris.
The AP notes that police have entered the concert venues where hostages are being held. In addition police confirm that attacks occurred at seven locations in Paris.
Reuters now reports that police have completed their operation at the concert venue and two gunmen have been killed.
Our thoughts and prayers tonight go out to the people of Paris and well be following this story as it develops.
Theres also something going on at the Eagles of Death Metal concertmay want to add that to the article too.
All of Europe is already lost. They may not want to acknowledge it but the Europe of years from now will be NOTHING like it exists today.
and the Europe of years ago was nothing like the Europe of years ago Its almost like time changes things
But lets let refugees into our country. Sure what could go wrong
What could go wrong Well for one they might be called RACISTS Imagine how that might make them feel
Yup. The next time someone points out how its wrong and racist that a certain type of person gets targeted for TSA pat down or FBI surveillance remind that person that he or she is an idiot.
How can a refugee crisis that came about because of the actions of the US and its allies be grouped together with these terror attacks Jawdroppingly stupid.
So I shouldnt blame Islamic terrorists Its amazing how stupid you all let yourselves sound in the name of political correctness. A goddam shame.
Talking about things the way they are in plain terms doesnt make someone a racist douchebag. Keeping your eyes closed to the obvious however makes you a moron.
But no resort to namecalling because your argument holds the water of a third graders. Idiot.
Paris is the greatest effing city in the world lets just hope those injured pullthrough and The City of Lights doesnt let the actions of some seriously about to be effed in the a people stop it from being a symbol of freedom and beauty.
I hate isis. uh oh thats not PC. I have to learn to be tolerant of isis and not judge them for their beliefs. isis needs their SAFE SPACE thats why they kill so many people
I cant be PC about this. According to reports I read online Europeans left to join ISIS. Theyre estimating that have returned. This proves why you need some form of intelligence program that includes surveillance. That means bugging cellphones internet etc. These guys are openly on social media. Enough with the PC bullshit its time to pull some tricks out of the bag. Start profiling at airports and in public places. There is no way to do any form of background search on some of the Syrian Refugees. I say let in women children and elderly. Young or middle aged men send them back. We all share a blame for this. Theyve killed children in children in Pakistan at the attack on the school. We have seen the attacks in Africa.
Terrorism hit the Atataturk airport in Istanbul last night as three suicide bombers exploded powerful devices that killed and injured a large number of people. The rising number of victims is currently dead and injured. ISIS is suspected as inspiring or directing the attack.
Cable news repeatedly showed frightening images of massive explosions in a transit lounge as well as a gunman running into the airport shooting a AK assault weapon who then is shot by airport security and drops his weapon only to blow his suicide vest up as he lies on the floor.
This latest attack comes on the heels of previous terrorist attacks in Turkey including two prior attacks in Istanbul this year including a car bomb earlier this month and a suicide bomber earlier this year as well as deadly car bombs in Ankara this year which doubtlessly will have the effect of frightening people from traveling or cruising to Turkey.
A number of newspapers have recently reported that the two terrorists attacks last year in Tunisiawhich killed cruise passengers from Costa and MSC cruise ships at the Bardo Museum in Tunis and later several dozens of British tourists on holiday at beach resorts in Sousse Tunisia is causing the countrys tourism industry to struggle. Skift reports that Tunisian tourist revenue was down percent last year at . billion and caused the dinar currency to historic lows against the dollar and euro this month.
This is bad news for the future of tourism in Turkey. There have been at least eight terror attacks in Turkey dating back a year. USA TODAY today published an article today which notes that the string of attacks have caused a big drop in tourism a major source of revenue for Turkey. Many cruise ships that used to make port calls in Istanbul are bypassing the city.
The CruiseArabia website says that justtwo international cruise ships were in Turkish waters at the time of the attack Tuesday both Wind Star and Royal Caribbeans Jewel of the Seas have continued with their cruise itineraries as planned.
At the time of writing Jewel of the Seas was in port in Kusudasi while Wind Star was anchored off Bodrum. Both Windstar Cruises and Royal Caribbean have refused to comment on whether any additional security has been put in place for passengers on shore excursions in the wake of the attacks.
Theres no question that cruising to Europe seems to be lagging behind cruises to other locations which are perceived to be safer like the Caribbean.We all know from comments by the cruise executives at Royal Caribbean following its last quarter that Americans Are Cruising Closer to U.S. Waters due to the terrorist activities in Paris and Brussels. 
The number one location that we are asked about is Turkey. To respond to such inquiries we mention prior terrorist attacks there and the issue of immigrants from Syria and other countries but the reader has to make up their own mind whether it is reasonably safe based on their own risk assessment.
But its naive to think that cruising to the Caribbean is safer than cruising to Europe. I can readily say that cruising to the Caribbean will take you to some of the most dangerous ports of call in the world not from terrorists mind you but from common criminals. Some of the Caribbean ports have a lot of crime and high murder rates which make cruising to Nassau St. Thomas and Roatan like cruising to East St. Louis Baltimore and Detroit except most U.S. citizens dont know any better. Europe is far safer than the Caribbean in terms of rape murder harassment and theft.
Most experts seems to say its just a matter of when and where not if ISIS will attack. The highly respected gCaptain reported yesterday that Captain William Nault Chief of Staff with the multinational Combined Maritime Forces CMF told Reutersthat Al Qaedas Yemen branch remains a powerful force and poses a growing risk to ships. 
We have seen other dontworryaboutathing articles from travel writers before likethe article in the Telegraph in February Are Cruise Holidays Safe from Terrorism written by U.K. cruise travel specialist Jane Archer who appeared to us to ignore history and downplay the threat of terror.
Chances are remote of course that you will be attacked by terrorists when you cruise in or around Europe. The chances of being a victim of crime in the Caribbean are greater. But as far as cruises in either part of the world you certainly arent nuts if you decide to vacation somewhere else this summer.
Stephen L. Caldwella member of the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee. downplayed the threat of international radical Islamic terrorism on the cruise industry in an article for Maritime Executive entitled Tightening the Security Envelope Despite all the hoopla about terrorist threats and onboard crime cruise ships are among the safest places on earth. He suggests that talk of terrorism is much ado about nothing. I posted Mr.Caldwells articleon our Facebook page with the comment thatif the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security is listening to this committee on international maritime security matters passengers are sitting ducks.
My view is that Mr. Caldwells naive article might as well have been written by the Cruise Line International Association for PR purposes. It is dangerously irresponsible to crew members and cruise passengers alike. I have expressed my feelings here about the threat of ISIS on cruise shipping many times before includingHow the Next Jihadist Terror Attack Against Cruise Passengers Will Happen.
He estimates that the chance that ISIS will attack blue water objectives out of sight of land is still remote as long as navies of the world continue to provide a credible presence on the oceans. However coastal attacks like that committed by ISIS predecessor Al Qaeda againstthe USS Coleattack diagram aboveremain more probable. And he specifically cites the terrorist attacks last March at the Bardo museum in Tunis when cruise passengers from a Costa and MSC cruise ship were killed. He also citesa shorelaunched rocket attack on an Egyptian naval ship in August of last year.
Mr. Goldstein the President and Chief Operating Officer of the cruise line explained that his company makes a lot of effort into its security. Royal Caribbeans cruise ships call on approximately ports annually. Like other companies it makes judgments based on the security information it has received prior to calling on a port. Occasionally it will decide that it is not in the best interests of the cruise line and its guests to go to a particular port like the recent case of Bali which its Celebrity Solstice and Royal Caribbean Radiance of the Seas avoided.
Most places Royal Caribbean sails to are absolutely safe Mr. Goldstein claims.
He said that after the terrorist attacks last year in Paris there was a brief decline in business of a week or two from Northern Europe countries. He said the effect on his cruise line business was de minimis. He does not expect anything different after this latest attack in Brussels.
The FOX News panel also questioned Mr. Goldstein on the effect of the Zika virus on bookings. He also downplayed the effect of this serious medical problem which is believed to cause abnormally underdeveloped heads microcephalyin newborn children.
This is an interesting perspective. Yesterday another financial show on CNBC Jim Cramers MAD MONEY suggested that although cruise lines deny that the Zika virus has affected their operations to date itwill severely impact cruising in the coming months.
Hello this is Royal Caribbean International. We would like to provide you with some important information regarding your March sailing onboard Radiance of the Seas. In an abundance of caution and based on the latest security information we have gathered Royal Caribbean International has made a decision to cancel its call to Bali Indonesia on Thursday March . Additional ports of call have been added to your itinerary. A letter with additional details will be provided to you at boarding. We appreciate your understanding as your safety is always our foremost concern.
Last week sister cruise line Celebrity distributed lettersto the passengers and crew members on the Celebrity Solstice indicating that the cruise ship will not be calling on Bali Benoa due to the potential of a terrorist attack. You can read our article Celebrity Solstice Cancels Stop in Bali Due to Concern of Terrorism.
Today I received copies of letters handed out to the passengers and crew members on the Celebrity Solstice indicating that the cruise ship will not be calling on Bali Benoa due to the potential of a terrorist attack.
the most recent information received in the past few days indicates that the possibility of an incident has increased. Also the Balinese New Year on March th and recent past advisories has named this date as one that would be targeted by terrorists. Based on all of this information we have gathered from various sources and in discussion with our Global Security team in Miami we have made a decision to cancel our call to Bali.
The letter mentions not to nitpick that Celebrity felt that it could not guarantee passenger safety in Bali due to these concerns. Of course cruise lines have no legal duty to guarantee safety but only to act reasonably and to warn passengers of dangers which the cruise companies know or should know about ashore in ports of call.
It looks like Celebrity is acting prudently in taking steps to reduce the threat of harm to its passengers and crew. I have been critical in the past of cruise lines when they cruise passenger into dangerous ports of call like when Costa and MSC sailed into La Goulette Tunisia and ISIS slaughtered several dozen cruise passengers.
The letter sent to the Celebrity crew members today by the Solstices Executive Team mentions what is referred to as credible security concerns that led to the decision to bypass Bali. 
Many crew members are from Indonesia and will now be unable to visit with their family and loved ones.
The Bali bombings photo above occurred in October of in the tourist district of Kuta on Bali. The attack killed over people including Australians Indonesians and people from more than other nationalities. An additional people were also injured.
Jemaah Islamiyah members a violent Islamist group supported by alQaeda were convicted of engaging in the bombings which involved the detonation of a backpack bomb by a suicide bomber and a large car bomb. Three of the terrorists were executed. A recording from Osama Bin Laden stated that the Bali bombings were in retaliation for support of the United States war on terror and Australias role in the liberation of East Timor.
The Jakarta Post recently published an article stating that cruise tourism is increasing in Bali the countrys most famous tourist destination. In cruise ships arrived on the island. 
Trave Agent Central points out that Celebritys sister cruise line Royal Caribbean which shares the same Global Security team is sailing the Radiance of the Seas to Bali later this month as well as in April.
Military.com reports that retired U.S. Admiral James Stavridis stated at a naval private industry conference that the next attack by Islamic State militants may be directed to a navy ship or a cruise ship.
He mentioned the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship by Palestinian militants who murdered JewishAmerican passenger Leon Klinghoffer.
The article mentioned that Commander Stavridis said that ships were most vulnerable when they were first getting underway and going out to sea not when they were pierside or out on the open ocean.If I were an Islamic State planner thats what I would be looking at he said.
This is one of the scenarios which I have mentioned in articles like al Qaeda Planned to Seize Cruise Ships Execute Passengers which I published four years ago andHow the Next Jihadist Terror Attack Against Cruise Passengers Will Happenwhich I published last year.
Some cruise lines have temporarily dropped ports in North Africa Tunisand in the eastern Mediterranean Turkey due to concerns with terrorist attacks. 
News accounts are reporting that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP arrested a cruise passenger in Miamion charges that he has outstanding arrest warrants for kidnapping as well as assault and battery.
The charges involve criminal allegations made in South Carolina. The newspapersaid the unidentified person is now awaiting extradition to South Carolina.
The above quote is rather bizarre because the man arrested is apparently an U.S. citizen who went on a cruise out of Miami which included a port in Jamaica. So the CBP should have arrested the cruise passenger on the assault and kidnapping charges at the beginning of the cruise rather than at the end.
The news release by the CBP is misleading and says that the man was arrested after he arrived here on a cruise ship from Jamaica. Of course there are no cruises which originate in Jamaica. 
The CBP boasts that the arrest demonstrates vigilance and dedication exercised every day by CBP officers to secure our homeland and safeguard our citizens. But the truth of the matter is that the CBP didnt bother to screen the cruise manifest and arrest the wanted man before he sailed from U.S. waters.
We have seen this problem many times. Read our article two years ago Are You Cruising with a Wanted Felon Five Passengers Arrested on Carnival Magic in Galveston.
This reveals a major flaw in the CBP which does not bother to review who is leaving the country on cruises. This person had an outstanding arrest warrant for serious violent felonies yet he was permitted on the unidentified cruise ship to mingle with passengers when potentially he posed a danger to others. 
The CBPs primary mission is antiterrorism it admits so it is inexcusable that it does not scrutinize passenger lists before cruise ships sail out of U.S waters. 
The Customs and Border Patrol should begin vetting the name of passengers before the cruise starts rather than screening passengers only at the end of the cruise. Unfortunately this is standard practice for the CBP which routinely permits rapists criminals with outstanding warrants and other misfits to board cruise ships. Then there is great fanfare at the end of the cruise when the CBP finally take a look at the ship manifest.
As we reported before cruise passengers Steven Mark Anthony Requena photo right age was arrested while disembarking the Carnival Inspiration at the Port of Tampa two year ago. His name was flagged by a sweep of the manifest of passengers by Homeland Security officials who determined that the passenger was wanted for sexual assault in addition to assault with a weapon and forcible confinement. The U.S. Marshals arrested Requena only after the cruise ship returned to port. Regretfully our federal government routinely looks at the ship passenger list only after the bad guys have already boarded the cruise ship.
It is one of the reasons why cruising is more dangerous that it should be. At a time when the world is focused on dealing with ISIS it is irresponsible for our Federal employees not to look at the passenger list before the cruise ship leaves a U.S. port.
Multiple news outlets in the U.K. are reporting that the U.K. naval commander for NATO is warning that ISIS presents a threat to shipping in the Mediterranean Sea.
The popular Daily Mail published UK Commander Warns Mediterranean Cruise Ships Could be Terror Targets.
Its a topic we cover often. It is our belief that cruise ships are woefully unprepared to address the threat of an ISIS attack on a cruise ship and when cruise passenger are sent ashore on excursions where they are particularly vulnerable. 
There are few travel writers willing to have a frank and realistic assessment of the vulnerability of cruise ships to terrorists.
Today the Telegraph published an articleAre Cruise Holidays Safe from Terrorismwritten by U.K. cruise travel specialist Jane Archer who in our assessment down played the threat or terror.
Ms. Archer also says that there is no evidence at all that terrorists have targeted cruise passengers in the past.
She also claims that cruise lines conduct stringent security checks on everyone embarking their ships. Luggage is put through Xray scanners just as it is at an airport before flying and passengers have to walk through detectors before being allowed on board.
Ms. Archers article is essentially a regurgitation of the talking points released by the cruise industrys trade organization Cruise Line International Association.
cruise tourists from a Costa and a MSC cruise ship were slaughtered when they disembarked excursion buses at the Bardo museum in Tunis with absolutely no security and no warnings even though it was widely known to these cruise lines that ISIS presented a danger in the region. The cruise lines cruised their guests into danger and should have sailed them elsewhere but didnt. Cruise lines are often motivated primarily by financial considerations not the safety and security of their passengers. 
Yes of course terrorists have targeted cruise passengers in the past. Putting aside the Achille Lauro terrorist attack back in the s the Rand corporation has more recently stated that cruise passengers are targets. CNN reported that al Qaeda contemplated seizing a cruise ship forcing the passengers to dress in orange Guantanamo Baylike suits and videotape their executions to inflict maximum terror on the public. Read al Qaeda Planned to Seize Cruise Ships Execute Passengers.Of course ISIS just targeted the cruise passengers excursion buses in Tunis.
Think that all passenger luggage is carefully screened for security purposes Ask yourself that question after readingPort of Miami Security Guards Arrested for Stealing Cruise Passenger iPads. Large quantities of drugs are also often smuggled aboard cruise ships by crew members without detection. If crew members or passengers can smuggle large quantities of drugs onto ships in luggage or taping the drugs to their bodies they can do the same with explosives.
U.S. immigrations officials typically do not review passenger manifests until after the cruise ship sails and arrest people with outstanding warrants only when the cruise ship returns to port. Are you about to cruise with a terrorist in the cabin next door Maybe. The Customs and Border Protection officials may arrest the bad guys but only if you make it back to port.
ISIS already blew up an Egyptian frigate at sea just last year photo above. As we all know Islamic extremists blew up the USS Cole many years ago by ramming a small boat packed with explosives into the naval ship killing many U.S. service men and women.
The warning signs are all there. Its your decision who to believe or disbelieve. Do you tend to trust the top NATOnaval commander for the U.K. or a cruise writer for the Telegraph
Yahoo Travel just interviewed me for its articleIs Your Cruise Ship Prepared for a Terrorist Attack
There are nearly comments to the article some of which are quite interesting to read.
The Yahoo article does not really touch upon the issue that cruise ships are largely unarmed. So regardless how you feel about the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution the cruise ships by and large dont have armed security guards. Contrary to people who want to believe that the ships are armed but the cruise lines dont want to tip their hand to the terrorists there is in fact no hidden cache of weapons ready to be deployed by the cruise ships security forces. 
Cruise ships are flagged in foreign countries like the Bahamas or Panama. The international Maritime Organization IMO has no authority to regulate the use of guns on these foreign flagged ship. The IMO does not even recommend that cruise ships have guns.
Are Cruise Lines Taking Adequate Steps to Protect Passengers from Pirate AttacksCruise Line Liability for Injuries to Passengers and Crew Members Caused by Pirate Attacks
Some cruise ships go as far as to install razor wire around the rails and position logs to be dropped on the pirates below if they run their skiffs up to the cruise ship. You can see a photo of this spectacle here.
As we explained in this article the IMO issued guidance on the use of armed guards on ships but stresses that it is still not recommending them. Instead it states that shipping companies should consider arming crew members or hiring private armed guards on board only after conducting a risk assessment subject to approval by the flag state. The IMO also recommends that shipping companies follow all laws and regulations imposed by that flag state regarding the use of armed guard apply to their vessels.
The only cruise ships which seems to permit weapons aboardare flagged in Italy which seems to have a different attitude towards guns and permits cruise ships flagged there like Costa to have weapons aboard.
A Costa ship got itself into a bit of scandal a couple of years ago when a female crew member was photographed holding a huge automatic weapon in the bridge of the cruise ship.The Italian newspaper Oggi published photographs of the attractive Romanian blonde Sasha Alexandra posing in the bridge of the Costa Atlantica. She was photographed next to the captain in a tight cocktail dress holding a large machine gun.
But cruise ships from Carnival Royal Caribbean or NCL flying the flags of the Bahamas or Panama have no weapons at sea.
Cruise lines cant even keep the Ranch Dressing filled at the salad bar . . You are fooling yourself if you think they would be able to fight off an armed boarding takeover attempt.
A Greek newspaper is reporting that the MSC Fantasia has been subjected to a search for explosives today after calling on Haifa.
The MSC cruise ship arrived today in the Bay of Souda near Chania in Crete. A Greek newspaper in Athens To Vima reports that suspicious passengers or explosives may be on board the ship.
The MSC ship carries passengers with a crew of people. The ship was originally headed for the port of Heraklion. The Coast Guard and other authorities at the Souda naval base were reportedly notified.
The newspaper says that the MSC Captain advised the authorities that the ship was changing course because of the weather and that a passenger apparently a German citizen had died and needed to be autopsied to determine whether the passenger died from cardiac causes as suspected. However the newspaper reports that the ship had already changed course for security reasons.
The article said that the recent terrorist attack inIstanbul by ISIS had raised an alert regarding terrorism including attacks on cruise ships sailing in the region.
A German newspaper contains a quote from MSC Cruises saying thatbad weather was the reason for the diversion. The cruise line said rumors of security issues are totally unfounded.
I would be interested in hearing what crew members and passenger have to say about the weather conditions at the time.
There nonetheless appears to be a heightened security alert following the terrorist attack in Turkey.
ABC News reported yesterday thatCrystal Cruises announced that it was canceling stops for the Crystal Symphony in Istanbul and Kusadasi Turkeyin response to ongoing security concerns.
The itineraries for Crystal voyages that set sail April and May will reportedly include destinations in Greece instead of Turkey.
U.S. cruise operators are being tight lipped about whether they are reasonably equipped to respond to security challenged presented by ISIS. However German tour operators recently admitted thatterrorism is their top challenge in . And German tourists may be rethinking their travel plans astourists have become terror targets.
The U.S. State Department has alerted its citizens of possible risks of travel due to increased terrorist threats. Current information suggests that ISIL aka Daesh alQaida Boko Haram and other terrorist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks in multiple regions. These attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics using conventional and nonconventional weapons and targeting both official and private interests.
The warning which technically ended on Tuesday advisesU.S. citizens to exercise vigilance when in public places or using transportation.
ISIS has claimed responsibility for a number of highprofile incidents including the October st bombing of a Russian airliner in Egypt killing people. on a flight fromSharm ElSheikh to St Petersburg and the recent November th attacks in Paris.
President Obama spoke this afternoon on the terror alert and stated that there is no specific and credible threat to the U.S. Even assuming that to be true there have no doubt been prior terrorist incidents which have affected cruise passengers. Cruise passengers from Costa and MSC cruise ships were massacred in Tunis last earlier this year. We have predicted how the next terrorist attack against a cruise ship will take place.
But what can a cruise passenger do Not much it seems. There is no right for a refund if theres a terrorist incident in a country where a cruise passenger is traveling to. Passengers from Viking River Cruises for example traveled around Paris in Viking buses after the recent attacks waiting for their cruises because they had no right to cancel their upcoming cruises. it goes without saying that the mere threat of an attack is a not legal basis to cancel a cruise with any reasonable expectation of obtaining a refund. ReadFive Myths About Travel Insurance and Terrorism.
Cruise Industry Believe Red Tape and Visa Restrictions are a Bigger Threat than Terrorism written by cruise fan and Mirror blogger Captain Greybeard suggests that the cruise line CEOs were downplaying the threat of terrorism this week at theSeatrade Europe conference held in Hamburg.
The Islamist Menace Shadowing This Sept. th written by former mayor of New York RudyGiuliani indicates that America is in denial of the increasing and diversifying jihadist threats of violence. Unlike President Obama who avoids any characterization of terrorism linked to Islamic radicalism Giuliani traces the threat of killing Americans in terror attacks squarely back to extremist interpretation of Muhammads call to jihad. He cites the murder of Jewish cruise passengerLeon Klinghoffer who was killed by Islamic terrorist terrorists while in his wheelchair and dumped into the Mediterranean Sea as an example of what can happen today. 
But families booking cruises to Mediterraneanports of call dont read history books. I doubt that percent of U.S. cruisers know the story of Leon Klinghoffer or could name the cruise ship he was slaughtered on.
This week I was contacted by cruise passengers who were upset that their cruises to Istanbul were canceled. They scoffed when the captain mentioned the threat of terrorism as an explanation.
ISIS radicals today present a threat far more widespread and deadly than the PLO terrorists of the s. Are cruise passengers in denial Yes of course.No one wants to contemplate terrorism at sea during a holiday cruise any more than they wish to consider experiencing a cruise ship fire which is a relatively common occurrence as recent events illustrate.
Are cruise executives downplaying the threat of ISIS blowing up a ship or holding passengers hostage Such talk is bad for business. Other than occasionally canceling a port of two the cruise industry routinely sails through the Suez canal and to ports in Morocco Algeria and Egypt.
Dont assume that the cruise lines will avoid a dangerous port of call. Islamic terrorists killed cruise passengers in Tunisia earlier this year when Costa and MSC cruised blindly into the Goulette port in Tunis. Despite the foreseeable risk of danger presented by Islamic terrorists active in the country and in nearby Libya the cruise lines provided absolutely no security or warnings to their guests.

Celebrity Cruises canceled a stop in Istanbul earlier this week because of concerns with terrorism. We were the first to report on the cancellationinvolving the Equinox.
Today Celebrity canceled more port stopsannouncing that the Reflection will not stay in Istanbul on August st and will depart earlier in the day. Celebrity will also skip theReflections port call in Istanbul on September th th and will instead call on Athens.
On August th Costa canceled all port stops in Istanbul for the remainder of the year.
Costa and other cruise lines are under pressure not to sail more passengers into danger like Costa recklessly did when it cruised to Tunisia in March resulting in passengers being slaughtered. I called for the security chiefs to be sacked.
There are hundreds of cruises scheduled for Istanbul this year. Expect more cancelations

Today I received a message from a passenger aboard the Celebrity Equinox that the Equinox was skipping the port of Istanbul because of the threat of terrorism.
Gabriele Giambrone commented that Celebrity Equinox canceled our planned stop in Istanbul tomorrow due to terrorist fears and high security alerts. We will be having a day at sea instead.
The Wall Street Journal recently mentioned a spate of attacks across Turkey that targeted security forces and a U.S. consulate killed six people.
A recent surge in violence on Turkish soil has largely been blamed on the domestic conflict with Kurdish separatist group PKK not Islamic State . . . Turkey is now battling a chaotic mix of the PKK Marxist militants and Islamic State while dealing with a huge influx of Syrian refugees.
Royal Caribbean and Celebrity have a Global Security Team headed by former FBI senior official Gary Bald. Foreign port safety assessment is a function of every cruise line. Its good to see cruise lines taking affirmative steps to keep passengers and crew members safe rather than Costa and MSC sailing their guests blindly into a danger spot like Tunis earlier this year.

The images posted on Twitteryesterday of ISIS blowing up an Egyptian Navy frigate are frightening.
ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The SITE Intel Group says that the terrorists destroyed the naval ship with a guided missile. The images were widely broadcast. Time and Al Jazeeraand many other newspapers and news stations published them.
Is it foreseeable that ISIS will attack a cruise ship Of course but you would never know that if you rely on the cruise industry or your local travel agent for information and advice.
The cruise industry has a nonchalant view of terrorism. It reassures its customers that its allegedly safe to cruise in the Mediterranean. Costa and MSC and five other cruise lines scheduled calls in Tunis La Gouletteeven after the Bardo Museum massacre where cruise passengers were slaughtered. The second attack in Tunisia was predictable and came in June when a single radicalized Muslim with a Kalashnikov gunned down more tourists at the resorts in Sousse. 
Cruise ships sailing in Mediterranean waters are sitting ducks. I have been criticized before for explaining how the terrorists will attack cruise passengers as they sail off the Coasts of Tunisia Libya and Egypt. 
Terrorists have demonstrated that they can blown up a U.S. Navy vessel USS Cole years ago. When the jihdists want to focus the crosshairs of their weapons on a slow moving cruise ship they can easily do so. The only question is whether the action will be in the form of an external attack suicidal jihadists on a small boat with explosives ram the ship or the terrorists fire RPGs into the hull or whether the terrorists will try and board the ship and take the cruise passengers hostage and begin beheading them on video. 
MSC and Costa sailed their guests into danger in March when terrorists slaughtered cruise tourists as they exited into the Tunis museum excursion site from cruise buses transporting them from the port. The cruise lines neither provided nor arranged security for their customers or for that matter announced even a single warning of the risks of danger.
The cruise lines ignored the considerable risks posed by the ISIS and Al Queda terrorists growing in neighboring Libya and already festering in Tunisia. After the bloodshed the cruise industry quickly launched a PR campaign stating that cruising to Tunis was safe.
SoonMSC and Costa began rescheduling calls to Tunis notwithstanding the loss of life.
Princess Croisieres De France CDF Holland America Line Viking Ocean Cruises and Star Clippers also scheduled cruise ship to head to Tunis as reported by the Cruise Arabia website.
But then terrorists targeted a resort in Tunisia frequented by tourists. On June th tourists were killed. Terrible gruesome deaths. These were not cruise vacationers but mostly British and European families on holiday so the story was not portrayed as an attack on the cruise industry. 
Today theprime minister of Tunisia says that additional plots aimed at massive deaths are in the works. He earlier declared a state of emergency.
tourists to Tunisia were killed in the two deadly attack in Tunisia in the past three months. I suppose it doesnt really matter what the PR departments of the cruise lines say anymore. Their lack of credibility has been established. I believe MinisterHabib Essid when he says that the terrorists are plotting the deaths of tourists whether they arrive by cruise ship airplane or bus.
I reached out today on Twitter and Facebook to determine which cruise lines canceled their stops in Tunis. A couple of passengers tell me that Costa which canceled cruise after the March attacks but scheduled stops in August just canceled some of their calls later this summer. But no word from any travel agents or cruise lines for that matter whether they are still selling cruises to North Africa.
Thirty of the people killed in Sousse were British tourists. Britains Foreign Office warned tourists Thursday to leave Tunisia as soon as possible saying a further terrorist attack was highly likely.
National Geographicals ombudsman Christopher Elliott just published the article which I wrote for Yahoo Travel tiltedIs Cruising Safe A Chilling Look at an Industry Under Siege.
Elliotts article is titledTerrorists Target Cruise Ships Heres What You Need to Know Now.
The poll confirms what I suspected about the cruise industry that is is perceived by the public as pushing itineraries in the Middle East which are potentially dangerous with little concerned about the safety of the passengers.
Costa and MSC Cruises did not issue a single warning to their passengers before unloading them in Tunis. Both cruise lines were pushing excursions in Tunisia. Neither cruise line arranged for security for the buses targeted by the terrorists. The cruise excursion buses unloaded the passengers into a trap because of the negligence of the cruise lines.
Will the cruise industry wake up and protect their guests It seems that the public thinks that the cruise lines can do a lot more.

Tunisia acknowledges it. The risk of jihadists attacking tourists was readily foreseeable. Security analysts and security forces blew it.
In response to this failure Tunisia fired the countrys leading security experts as well as highrankingpolice officers.
Al Jazeera publishedSix Tunisia Police Chiefs Dismissed Over Museum Attack. The article explains thatTunisias prime minister Habas Essid fired six police commanders including those in charge of tourist security and intelligence teams. In addition apolice officer working at the museum was arrested for abandoning his post during the attack.Four other armed police officers were having coffees and a snack when terrorists struck the museum.
The Daily News publishedTunisia Fires Top Security Officials in Bardo Museum Attack Backlash.The article pointed out that the ousted officials include the director of Tunisias tourist police and the police chief for the neighborhood around the Bardo Museum.The decision was reportedly made after the prime minister visited the neighborhood of the attack and observed security problems. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi reportedly also criticized security failures around last weeks attack.
But what about the security chief at Costa and MSC including ship security officers and fleetwide security directors Why werent they fired They are just as responsible for the security failure. The cruise lines picked the port and sailed their guests into danger without any security protection or warnings. The cruise industry is not only refusing to take any responsibility for the massacre but the spokesperson for the Cruise Line International Association CLIAis boasting that cruise ships are a safe and secure place for our guests in the rare event of a shore side incident.
MSC Cruises USA CEO Rick Sasso told Travel Pulse There was no hint of terrorism or uncertainty in Tunisia before the attack . . . There are a zillion ports around the world and we follow all of them. . . There was nothing going on there that indicated this shouldve been a concern.
I am amazed how clueless this cruise executive sounds. Tunisian soldiers were engaged in ongoing battles against Al Qaeda there were prior suicides bombers which targeted hotels and museum attacks which targeted tourists. The UK issued a prior warning of a terrorist attack on tourist sites and the US repeatedly urged caution. ISIS was recruiting young men from mosques in Tunis to be trained and radicalized in Libya. And MSC sails in like everything is fine. 
Its a shame that the PR department at CLIA and the CEO of MSC areengaged in their usual irresponsible shenanigans and gobbledygook.

For the past couple of years Ive been troubled by the increasing violence in North Africa and the Middle East and the unprecedented nature of the cruelty of jihadist terrorists who have beheaded and burned infidels alive.I have worried about various scenarios where cruise passengers are at risk of attack.
We already know that al Qaeda has planned to seize cruise ships and execute passengers.
Our readers have sent us various scenarios of how cruise passengers are at risk on the high seas and in ports of call.
Think its far fetched Think again. Al Qaeda has already used this weapon to attack tankers in the Middle East. In the video below you can see the terrorists fire their weapons yell Allah Akbar God is Great and run off into the bushes. Cruise ships are easy targets over three football fields long and stories high moving at only a few knots an hours while entering and leaving ports. A RPG would slice though the aluminum hull like butter and cause fire damage injuries and death. Theyre sitting ducks without military escorts.
. . . This isnt about the ports and the safety of them. A terrorist could be among you at the buffet laying by the pool playing slots drinking at the bar they lay in wait. Theyre completely legitimate looking like one of us. of them could board a ship as a passenger with a clean record. Theyve been trained in other countries. Theyve lived in the countries theyre in for years and they lay in wait anticipating their marching orders. Then three days into the cruise they take over the ship and start killing passengers . . . And thats how itll go down.
The cruise industry needs to wake up. Tunis was preventable. Greater attention to Al Qaeda and ISIS is necessaryto avoid a similar if not worse attack on innocent passengers. Dangerous ports need to be avoided. In the past Princess Cruises used security teams police to accompany tour bus excursions in Egypt. Maritime security teams are also required in foreign ports of call to address the risk of waterborne attacks. Cruise lines are overflowing with cash. The cruise industry collects around billion a year pay their crew members peanuts and doesnt pay U.S. taxes. The industry needs to start investing some of those tens of millions of dollars into substantial security to keep their guests safe.

The cruise industrys favorite publication Travel Weekly just published an article titled After Tunis attack Impact on Cruise Sales Pondered.
The article speculates whether cruise sales will drop following the Islamic States massacre of cruise passengers in Tunis last week.
In the last couple of years first quarter wave sales were negatively impacted by the Costa Concordia disaster in January and the Carnival Triumph poop cruise in February . The article suggests that whereas the sinking and engine room fire could arguably be blamed on the cruise lines the public is not likely to fault the cruise lines for the terror attack last week.
I disagree with that premise. Costa and MSC sailed into a country with a history of fighting between Tunisian solders and Al Qaeda resulting in dozen of soldiers killed and wounded over the last two years. Tunisian men have been recruited to train in ISIS camps inLibya. There had been prior attacks against a popular museum in Tunisia and a suicide bomber blew himself up in a hotel frequented by tourists.What did the cruise lines think would happen after Tunisians were radicalized and trained to use automatic weapons in Libya and then returned home
The public can easily conclude that the cruise lines sailed their guests into harms way without warnings or any thought of providing security for the excursion buses.
But the cruise supporters are out in full force spinning the story to exculpate the cruise lines.
Bud Darr a mouthpiece for the Cruise Line International association CLIA argues that the terror attack against cruise passengers was not targeted at cruise passengers.
The editor of Cruise Week Mike Driscoll spun the attackoncruisepassengers as not a black eye for cruising because its not the cruise lines fault and it didnt happen on a ship.
Travel Weekly interviewed a travel agent who said I think were all keeping our fingers crossed that this will not have a negative impact.
Travel Weekly published statements from the Cruise Line International Association CLIA who claims that cruise lines have worked for many years with security and law enforcement authorities around the world to ensure passenger safety. CLIA claims that it hasprocedures to provide an immediate and effective response to any securityincident.
The day before the attack the cruise executives were salivating over expanding their markets into North Africa and making greater profits. Their minds were on money not security. 
A former cruise line security chief was highly critical of the absence of any security for the Costa and MSC cruise passengers. 
CLIA and Travel publications like Travel Weekly will continue issuingstatements and publishing stories claiming that cruise passengers are safe and sound in North Africa and the Middle East. But thespecter of dead passengers certainly will scare customers away and drive down cruise sales especially in the Mediterranean. If the cruise industry is going to cross its fingers it better be in the hope that ISIS doesnt target a cruise ship.

As the death toll increases in Tunis the former Director of Princess Cruises says that cruise security was lax and the cruise lines failed to assess the danger associated with sailing passengers into Tunis.
Commander Mark Gaouette told IHS Maritime that cruise security measures for passengers should have been stronger.
I believe the risk management process failed to properly assess the extremely volatile situation in North Africa he said.
. . . at a minimum more security should have been required for that excursion in the form of armed police or military escort and armed presence at the museum itself.
The death and injury tally ranges around dead and to passengers injured.
I remain amazed that the Costa captain piloted the Costa Fascinosa out of the port in Tunis and left passengers behind not knowing whether they were dead or injured. I cant help but think of Costa Captain Schettino leaving passengers behind as he fled the sinking Concordia in Giglio. Do I have this wrong To give the Fascinosacaptain the benefit of the doubt I can only assume that he may have been concerned that terrorists might attack the ship itself and slam RPGs into its hull or gun their way up the gangway and look for hostages. In that sense maybe it was prudent to escape the port as soon as possible although it begs the question why Costa was there in the first place. 
Why any cruise line would sail into Tunis is beyond me. In and many dozens ofTunisian soldiers were killed and even more injured in deadly attacks perpetrated by alQaeda and other Islamic fighters according to an article titled Terror and Politics in Tunisia in the publication World Affairs. Tunisia is a major recruiting ground for ISIS. Recruits are trained in Iraq Syria or Libya and then return to Tunisia radicalized. 
Costa and MSC have stated that they will not call on Tunisia in the foreseeable future. To me thats like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted as the saying goes. Whether these cruise ships will actually stay away remains to be seen. We have seen cruise lines announce with great fanfare that they are leaving a Caribbean port after a cruise passenger or employee has been killed ashore. They always return after the media attention dies down.

Newspapers are reporting that severalgunmen stormed a popular museum in Tunis Tunisia today killing tourists as well as a police officer and Tunisian civilians. Some news accounts report that as many as two dozen people were also injured.
Two cruise ships were in port and had sent thousands of passengers into the city on excursions. CNN says that some of the cruise passengers were at the museum at the time of the attack. The Daily Mail reports that aTunisian tourist guide told how he stared death in the face as terrorists opened fire on his clients in the attack which saw people shot as they exited cruise ship buses parked outside the museum.
CBS News says that the terrorists targeted tourist buses when they arrived at the museum. The terrorists dressed in police uniforms then opened fire on the tourists before they could reach the museum. 
On the occasion of today scheduled call some guests on cruise on board our Costa Fascinosa had a tour in the city. All the shore excursions organized by Costa during today stop in Tunis have been immediately recalled on board the company said in a statement. 
The Italian newspaper stated that the Bardo museum is visited regularly by tourists with many disembarking from Mediterranean cruises.
Commentators believe that the group is affiliated with an Islamic terrorist organization like ISIS. Tunisia is a major recruiting ground for ISIS.

One question I am asked frequently is whether Islamic terrorists pose a threat to cruise ships. I received a couple of such inquiries in the last week. One from a mother in the U.K. whose son works on a cruise ship sailing the Mediterranean and another from the father of a family in the U.S. thinking about taking a cruise from Spain to France Italy Greece and Turkey and back. 
Yesterday several newspapers in Europe and the Middle East Mail OnlineAl Arabiya News interviewed experts who have painted the scenario of speed boats operated by Islamic State terrorists attacking fishing boats cruise ships and small merchant ships to capture people and parade them in orange jumpsuits before a video with a knife to their neck. 
We have all seen the stories on CNN about the gruesome killing and beheading of innocent aid workers and journalists by ISIS in an effort to terrorize the televised world. In the last two weeks we have also read stories about the barbaric burningaliveinacage of the Jordanian pilot and the beheading of twentyone Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya. We are of course all afraid to actually see the videos of the terrifying violence.
As we sit in front of the television in our homes here in the U.S. we all feel safe from the terrorists dont we The beheadings are after all over there in foreign places like Iraq Syria Yemen Libya and other unstable Arab countries.
But when U.S. citizens decide to fly to Europe and go on a cruise vacation with their family in the Mediterranean are they placing themselves in harms way
The thought of Muslim terrorists hijacking a cruise ship is hardly new.Achille Laura instantly comes to mind. Forcing terrified cruise ship hostages into orange suits and executing them al Queda has already planned thatjust a couple of years ago. CNN would cover the terror nonstop.
There are numerous studies by security companies and U.S. governmental organizations which have studied terrorist organizations and concluded that terrorism against cruise ships is likely.
The World Cruise Industry Review publication concluded several years ago that a likely terrorist scenario is the hijacking of a cruise ship and its passengers while terrorists kill passengers if demands are not met.
The issue has been discussed by a number of experts including Commander Mark Gaouette who is the former director of security for Princess. He wrote a book Cruising for Trouble which specifically addresses the potential of a cruise ship as a target for terrorists.
years ago U.S. service men and women were brutally murdered when Islamic suicide bombers rammed their speed boat loaded with explosives into the U.S. navy ship the U.S. Cole.
If the U.S. Navy cant protect its military fleet what chances do thousands of U.S. tourists think they have of staying safe on a gigantic U.S. based cruise ship floating like a sitting duck in the harbor ofSharm elSheikh Egypt
ISIS has already taken over port cities in Libya which is strategically located in the middle of North Africa. It would be easy for ISIS to launch a suicide jihadbysea against cruise ships sailing to or from North Africa and the Middle East.
Jihadists are already using cruise ships to sneak into war zones says the Maritime Executive.The fear is that the radicals will shift their focus to making the ship itself the war zone.
Families thinking of cruising in the Pacific Northwest Seattle Vancouver Alaska may be reasonably safe from an ISIS attack. A terrorist attack seems extremely unlikely to happen in the Caribbean. But sailing into a port in Morocco Tunisia or Egypt on a cruise ship Its not a matter of if. Its just a matter of when.
The Associated Press AP reports that jihadi fighters are increasingly buying tickets on cruise ships to join extremists in battle zones in Syria and Iraq.
The AP states that jihadists are tryingto bypass travel restrictions in neighboring Turkey.
According to the APTurkey says that it has been deporting hundreds of terrorists caught in airports and bus stations. But there are some fighters or more from countries traveling to the Middle East to fight for extreme Islamic causes.
The BBC reports that Islamic militants areusing of cruise ships more and more.
Originally our concern about people on cruise ships dangerous people on cruise ships really focused on the classic sort of rapist burglar or violent criminal. But as weve gathered data weve realized that there are more and more reports that people are using cruise ships in order to get to launch pads if you will sort of closer to the conflict zones of Syria and Iraq.
Terrorism is a concern for any kind of international travel. The current news does not suggest an attack by such groups on cruise ships but there is historical evidence of such attacks.We have written about plans uncovered two years ago by al Qaeda to seize cruise ships and dress passengers in orange jump suits and execute them. Three decades ago Arab terrorists killed cruise passengerLeon Klinghoffer on the Achille Lauro cruise ship and a decade ago our U.S. Navy lost several dozen sailors who were blown up during the attack on the U.S.S. Cole by an al Qaeda group.
Several readers of Cruise Law News sent us articles today reporting that Greek police officers boarded the Costa Magica while it was in the Port in Piraeus Greece and arrested four passengers who had possession of firearms. 
The Croatian newspaperSlobodna Dalmacija Daily reports that the incident occurred on Thursday October nd.
Approximately other passengers embarked from Venice on a sevenday Mediterranean cruise. Once the ship reached Greece the Greek police boarded the Magica and arrested one woman and three men for possession of firearms pistols.
The cruise ship was delayed departing from Piraeus because of the incident. The incident was not announced on the ship and the passengers seemed to be unaware of it.
The newspaper says that the news about the arrest of four passengers could not be found either in the Greek or in the Italian media. The newspaper interviewed crew members from Dubrovnik who explained the circumstances surrounding the arrests.
The newspaper say that the information was suppressed because it was bad for the cruise industrys business.
Those interviewed explained that there are passengers and suitcases simultaneously screened in just a few hours and it is impossible to effectively screen so many passengers and luggage in such little time.
This is particularly worrying the newspaper suggested when the Islamic states repeatedly threaten harm to the Americans and their allies.
The article is entitled The Terrorists Tried to Hijack the Cruise Ship with Passengers.
There is no indication why the passengers had the guns nor is there any proof or explanation in the newspaper that they were in fact terrorists.
Anyone with more information about this incident please leave a comment below or join the discussion on our Facebook page.
A number of news sources are reporting that the Tunisian government prohibitedIsraeli passengers from disembarking from a cruise ship at a stop at the Port of Tunis.
Norwegian Cruise Line NCL a U.S.based cruise line told the Israeli citizensthat they were not welcome by the Tunisian government and had to stay aboard the cruise ship.
Bnai Brith Canada released a statement yesterday stating that there were approximately Israelis on board the NCLship. They did not know in advance that they could not leave the ship during the port of call.
According to the Jewish Telegraphic AgencyJTA the cruise line had a responsibility to its passengers and to advise them of this discriminatory policy in advance Bnai Brith Canada CEO Frank Dimant said in a statement. Better still the cruise line should avoid ports that have such policies.
During Norwegian Jades port call in La Goulette Tunisia on Sunday March a small number of guests holding Israeli passports were not allowed to go ashore because of a last minute decision made by the Tunisian Government. Port taxes for the call in Tunisia are being refunded to these guests.
We apologize for any inconvenience to our guests and appreciate their understanding. We are reviewing this decision with the appropriate officials.
NCLs statement is pathetic. NCL should not be downplaying the incident like this. The Tunisian governments action should be immediately and unequivocally denounced in the strongest language possible. 
This is not about returning nominal port taxes to inconvenienced guests. It is about much deeper and important issues. No citizens of any nation should be subjected to such discrimination. The fact that an Arab nation would exhibit such contempt and hostility against Israel is particularly despicable.
What lessons were learned from the hijacking of the Achilles Lauro cruise ship and the murder of passenger Leon Klinghoffer Have we forgotten his death and the terror inflicted by an Arab terrorist group against cruise ship passengers in the Mediterranean and ending in the murder of a Jewish passenger 
Tunisias actions sent a clear message to Israeli citizens. NCLs response should be equally clear. The only reasonable action is for NCL and the cruise industry to boycott Tunis as a port.
We want to send a strong message to Tunisia and ports around the world that we will not tolerate such random acts of discrimination against our guests. We are outraged by this act and the fact that we were not notified in advance of this practice. We apologize sincerely to our guests who were affected and want them to know that we have taken the appropriate action in response.
NCL announced the boycott during the Cruise Shipping Miami CSM today. I walked by the Tunisia delegation photo left. They must be feeling rather foolish.
Newspapers in Cyprus and Israel are reporting that security forces in Cyprus thwarted a planned terror attack against Israeli tourists.
Cypriot security forces seized a powerful explosive in the port of Limassol local paper Alithia reported. The explosive was described as capable of causing massive damage.
The newspapers state that the perpetrators intended to target Israeli tourists visiting on cruise ships to Cyprus which is a popular tourist destination for Israelis.
Earlier this summer Cyprus arrested a Lebanese man with links to Hezbollah who was planning attacks on Israelis in the country. Israel has said the attacks were part of a concerted effort by Iran which employs the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah as its proxy to target Israelis around the world.
Years After Hijacking of Achille Lauro Can Cruise Ships Keep Passengers Safe in the MiddleEast
In April I blogged about a plot where Arab terrorists envisioned hijacking a U.S. based cruise ship forcing the passengers to wear orange Guantanamolike jump suits and then videotaping their execution.
There are numerous studies by security companies and U.S. governmental organizations which have studied terrorist organizations and concluded that terrorism against cruise ships is likely.
The issue has been written about by a number of experts including Commander Mark Gaouette who is the former director of security for Princess cruise line. He wrote a book specifically addressing the issue of cruise ships as a target for terrorists.
Twentyseven years ago today the world saw terrifying television images of Palestinian terrorists holding passengers aboard the Achille Lauro cruise ship hostage. The terrorists demanded the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
There were over nationalities of passengers booked on the cruise but the terrorists stated that Americans would be the first to be executed if their demands were not met. 
Leon Klinghoffer age was from New York City and was vacationing with his wife Marilyn and their friends when the Achille Laurosailed for Port Said Egypt. Although Mr. Klinghoffer was disabled and in a wheelchair the terrorists picked him to be the first to die. They shot him in the chest and head and then forced two crew members to dump him and his wheelchair over the side of the cruise ship.
That terrible crime occurred in October . Now years later are cruise passengers particularly Americans any safer
We have seen civil unrest across North Africa. President Mubarek is gone from Egypt and Colonel Gaddafi of Libya is dead. Good riddance to both I saybut both countries now seem more dangerous to Americans than ever. Last month we saw antiAmerican demonstrations on the anniversary in both of these countries and the murder of the U.S. Ambassador to Libya in Benghazi.
On the front page above the crease of the New York Times this morning are several articles about violence in Syria with a photo of a Syrian firing a Kalashnikov rifle. I not sure who is fighting who anymore but they all seem to have the potential to take their violence to U.S. interests.
In April I blogged about a plot where Arab terrorists envisioned hijacking a U.S. based cruise ship forcing the passengers to wear orange Guantanamolike jump suits and then videotaping their execution.
years after Leon Klinghoffers dead body was dumped into the Mediterranean Sea the danger of terrorism against cruise ship passengers seems greater than ever before. Have cruise ships increased the number of security guards aboard their cruise ships I doubt it. Every cabin occupied by a security guard means less revenue for the cruise lines. 
The current strategy seems to be to simply skip ports in Egypt Morocco and Tunisia until things calm down. But thats a short turn fix when the street protests are over there remains the risk of jihadists plotting a cruise ship to target. Will the cruise security teams be ready
If terrorists can overpower several heavily armed U.S. Marines and kill our Ambassador in Libya does anyone really think that they are safe sailing on a Holland America Line or Princess cruise ship sailing into Tunis or Port Said
The disturbing trend of violence against the U.S. in places like Libya and Egypt is causing the cruise lines to scramble to swap out ports of call in North Africa for ports in Italy and Malta.
HALs Ryndam skipped a port Tunisia yesterday and instead visited Sardinia Italy.Royal Caribbeans Mariner of the Seas will avoid Alexandria Egypt next week and will call on Sicily and Valletta Malta on the next two days.Cunards Queen Elizabeth skipped a call today in Alexandria and will visit Rhodes tomorrow.
In April I blogged about a plot where Arab terrorists envisioned hijacking a U.S. based cruise ship forcing the passengers to wear orange Guantanamolike jump suits and then videotaping their execution.
There are numerous studies by security companies and U.S. governmental organizations which have studied terrorist organizations and concluded that terrorism against cruise ships is likely. Take a look at this report by the RANDorganization.
When I was a kid my family lived in Tripoli Libya starting in until the s. The Libyan people back then mostly Sunni Muslims were peaceful. But today Libya Egypt Tunisia or Morocco are the last places on earth I would sail my family to. 
Cruise ships are simply not equipped to handle a terrorist attack. Cruise ship security cant even handle drunk passengers. And I would not trust the port authorities in these Arab countries to provide adequate protection against Islamic fanatics strapped with explosives who would love to blow up a cruise ship with Americans aboard.
There is a disturbing story today in CNN entitled Documents Reveal al Qaedas Plans to Seize Cruise Ships . . . The CNN article explains that an alQaeda operative was caught with encoded digital data which once deciphered revealed some of the terror groups most audacious plots and a road map for future operations. 
The terrorist group had far reaching plans to conduct operations in Europe and to kill cruise ship passengers as part of its reign of terror.
Musharbash takes that to mean that the terrorists would then start executing passengers on those ships and demand the release of particular prisoners.
The plan would include dressing passengers in orange jump suits as if they were al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and then videotaping their execution.
Are cruise ships prepared to deal with a well organized attack by a jihadist terrorist organization 
Do you believe that the cruise industry has done enough to protect passengers from terrorism or are cruise vacationers sitting ducks Please leave a comment below.
CBS Channel reported today that acheck of a suspicious package at thePort of Miami resulted in the evacuation of a cruise ship terminal. The evacuation was orderedaftera police dog alerted to the package.
Miami police ordered the evacuation of Terminal C which was in use Friday by NCLsNorwegian Sky cruise ship. CBS reported that the evacuation covered only cruise and port employees working in the terminal becausecruise passengers arriving Friday had yet to be allowed inside to board Fridays cruise.
The MiamiDade bomb squadand HazMat crews were was called to check the package. A port official eventually said the package turned washarmless.
The AP is reporting thata twentythree year man whohad apparently been placed ona nofly listtraveled from Oregon to New Yorkby train and then boarded a cruise ship in order to sailto England.
The article identifiesMichael Migliore as a Muslim convertwhohad tried unsuccessfully for months to fly to Italy where he planned to live with his mother.
According to the AP Miglioresaysheis on the nofly listbecause he refused to cooperate with FBI agents who wanted to question him after an acquaintance was charged in a plot to bomb a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland.
After being barred from flying Mr.Migliore decided to travel across the U.S. by train and then sail on a cruise ship to Europe. Once he arrived in England the British police arrested him.
Now this strikes me as rather strange. I dont know Mr. Migliore.I have no idea whether he is a potential terrorist threat or a nice guywho was arbitrarily labeled a threat because he converted to Islam. I tend to sympathize with U.S. citizenshavingtheir liberties taken away withoutnotice or due process.
But ifthe U.S. really placed him on a nofly list because of a good faith belief that he is prone to blow up a airplane whydidnt it place him on a nocruise list Thisstarted me thinking is there such a thing as a nocruise list If not why not If you are inclinedto take down an aircraft it seems like a cruiseship is an equally attractive target.
Does the Transportation Safety Administration TSA Homeland Securitythe FBIand Customs and Borderpeopleshare information of potential dangers in the air and on the sea If sowhy is someone who is such a danger to be placedon a nofly list permitted to board a cruiseship for a transatlantic cruise
This weekendour television has alternated between college football games and documentaries about the horror of .
Iwas in my office talking to Dad who was with my Mom visiting my sister in Park City Utah. I waswith him on thetelephone when the first tower began to fall.I remember himyellingholy shit son the tower is falling We then both hung upto watch the spectacle.
There have been some insightful articles about how disruptedourlives and changed our perspective of the world around us. The Connecticut Post published an interesting article A September Cruise Leads Passenger Home to a Changed City which is the account of a real estate agent in Connecticut who goes with her husband on a cruisefrom Southamptonwhen the plane struck the twin towers.
The towers were a landmark that seemed to always be in the background of every cruise ship photographed in New York harbor. I found such a photo and thought it might beappropriate to add it to this article. But while uploading it I realized that it shows the H.M.SBritaniswhichsank off of the coast of South Africa in October .
to me brought home the fact that all of us arehere onplanet earth for a limited period of time. Great buildings can fall before our eyes. Magnificent ships can sink out of sight as if they never existed. Loved ones can leave us.

The Tribune newspaper in the Bahamas is reporting that a pleasure cruise on board the Discovery cruise ship turned into terror and aggravation for hundreds of passengers when a bomb threat stopped the shipat night en route to Port Everglades in Ft. Lauderdale. The incident began whenMiami Dade Police Department received a call around PMthat a man was aboard the shipwitha gun and a bomb.
The Discovery cruise ship ship leftGrand Bahama with approximately passengers around PM. The fivehour cruise back toPort Everglades usually arrives around . PM.
The newspaper indicates that passengers were restricted to their cabins and in certain areas of the ship while the search was conducted. The newspaper also quotes a passenger stating that everyone was very scared and some persons were even upset because of the long delay and late arrival into Fort Lauderdale.

One of theproposals recommended bythe International Cruise Victims ICV organization ishaving sea marshals on cruise ships in order to protect passengers and respond to shipboard crimes.
Since the Federal government has placedair marshals on airplanes. The ICV has attempted to ensure that cruise ships have the same level of security by supporting legislation in California requiringsea marshals on all cruise ships entering and departingcruiseports in that state.
Unfortunately the cruise industry fought againstan independent police force on cruise ships.The typical argument is that state law enforcement have no jurisdiction over foreign flag cruise ships on international waters. However there is no question that states like California have jurisdiction to place sea marshals on cruise ships once the ships reach state waters to act as a police presence andto monitor environmental activities. Alaska has a very effective sea marshal program designed to monitor cruise ship waste waterdumping.
The port of Los Angeles already has a sea marshal program. By all accounts it is successful and serves the valuable purpose of protecting passengers. As explained in an article today Marshals Defend Port of L.A. in the Contra Costa Timesthe port of Los Angeles hassixsea marshals as well asan additional eight to port police officers who are trained to join the team.The L.A. sea marshal program is seperate from the sea marshal program operated by the U.S. Coast Guard which board vessels up to milesoffshore.
The sea marshal program in L.A. isgeared toward addressing vulnerabilities ascruise ships and cargo vesselhead into and out oftheharbor.Sea marshals boardcruise ships miles from port. They arearmed. They make sure that no one forces their way into the bridge tohijackthe ship and uses itasa floating bomb or abattering ram just as alQaida terrorists forced their way into the cockpits of jetliners on .
Sea marshals also inspect various areas of the cruise ship look for explosives drugs suspicious activities and coordinateunderwater inspections byport police divers once thecruise shipsreach port. Theyremain onthe bridge where they keepwatch asthe cruise ships sail out of the Port of Los Angeles. They return to port once the vessels reach miles offshore.
It remains less than clear whether the sea marshalsin Los Angeleshave responsibility to handle reports of crime which occur at sea as the cruise ships sail back to California. Undoubtedly the local sea marshals can liason with the Los Angeles Port Police andthe FBI.
Los Angeles has proven that a sea marshal programon a state level can work. More ports and states need to followLos Angeless lead.
This month is the th year anniversary of the death ofcruise ship passenger Leon Klinghoffer an American Jewwho was killed byPalestinianterrorists who hijacked the cruise ship he was sailing on with his wife in the Mediterranean Sea in .
Mr. Klinghoffer age wasfrom New YorkCity and was vacationingwith his wifeMarilyn and their friends when fourheavily armedterrorists hijacked the Achille Lauro cruise shipafter it left Port SaidEgypt. Although Mr. Klinghoffer was disabled and in a wheelchair the terroristsshot him in the chest and head and then forced two crew members to dumphim and the wheelchair he was confined to over the side of the cruise ship.
The terrorists demanded the captain sail the cruise ship to Syria andIsrael release Palestinian prisoners.After a twoday drama the hijackers surrendered in exchange for a pledge of safe passage out of Egypt to Tunisia.But when an Egyptian jet tried to fly the hijackers away from justiceU.S. Navy F fighters intercepted the jet and forced it to landin Sicily. The terrorists were taken into custody by Italian authorities. The four terrorists were convicted and sentenced to jail but a mediator Abu Abbas from thePalestinian Liberation Army PLO who planned the hijacking waspermitted to leave Italy to the outrage of Americans. The U.S. Army subsequently captured Abbasduring the invasion of Iraq.
The tragicincident isknownfor the brutalnature of the Palestinian terrorists against Mr. Klinghoffer the involvement of the PLOand the bold action of President Reagan in foiling the terroristsescape.
But thetheincidentis also well known in legal circles fordemonstrating the extraordinary steps which cruise linestake to limit their liability.
Mrs.Klinghofferand the estate of Leon Klinghoffer daughters LisaandIlsa were the administrators filedsuit in the Southern District of New York against the owner operator chartererof the Achille Laurotravel agenciesvarious other defendants and eventually the PLO. Other passengers who were aboard the Achille Lauro during the hijacking also filed suit.
The familiessued the cruise linedefendantsfor failing to have adequate security to protect the passengers from the terrorist attack.
The cruise ship was operated by the Lauro Line and marketed by the Chandris Line whose risk management department was based in New York City. The claims supervisorsubsequently went to workfor Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises.
Rather than trying to reach a settlement with the grieving family the cruise line defendants threw upevery obstacle imaginable to prevent the Klinghoffer family from obtaining compensation. The cruise linedenied responsibility and claimed that the attack was unforseeable. They filed motionsto dismiss claiming that they did not engage inbusiness in the U.S. They argued that the forum selection clause which we have discussed inother articles in the passenger ticket limited their liability to only and in any eventanylawsuithad to bebrought in Naples Italy.The cruise line defendant thenfiled claims against the PLO arguing thatif anyone should be responsible for Mr. Klinghoffers death it was the PLO for planningthe hijacking of the cruise ship.
The lawsuits lasted over years at great emotional and financial expense of the Klinghoffer family.
Finally the cases were resolved shortly before trial when the PLO made a confidential financial settlement which resulted in the creation of a nonprofit organization the Leonand Marilyn Klinghoffer Memorial Foundation.
As a result of the ordealour U.S. Congress enacted legislation which provides a basis to sue terrorist organizations when they are involved in the deaths of U.S. citizens.Cruise lines however remain free to use forumselection clauses and contractual limitations of liability to make it difficultfor Americans to obtain compensation.
The lastingmaritime law implications ofMr. Klinghoffers death is thatno cruise line can realisticallyclaim that the hijacking of a cruise ship by a terrorist organization isunforeseeable given the vivid memories of that terrible day twenty five years ago on the Achille Lauro.
Daughters Keep Up Terror Fight for Leon Klinghoffer years after Attack on Achille LauroNY Daily News
I responded immediately that it was in violation of international law and morally indefensible.
For those cruise fans who are not current on international news two days agoIsraelicommandos boardedacruise shipin international waters.The ship is the MV Mavi Marmarapassenger ship formerly owned and operated by a Turkish ferry company and now owned by a Turkish Islamist charity the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedom and Humanitarian Relief. TheMavi Marmara with around Palestinian supporters was sailingwith food toys andrelief supplies for Palestiniansin Gaza.Israel boarded the ship to enforce an embargo of Gaza.
Passengers on the cruise ship called activists in many press accounts attackedthe commandos after they rappelled from a helicopter. Watch the video below. Whenthe violence ended Israeli forces had killed passengers and injured others. The passengers injured Israeli soldiers critically.
My opinion remains that this was a clear violation of international maritime law. TheU.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea entitlesvessels free passage on the high seas. It was also amorally indefensible attack on citizens in international waters. I received a lot of flak for my opinions. There are few peoplein the U.S. based cruise industry orcourthouses in Miami who have much sympathy for the Palestinian cause particularly after . The U.S. is preoccupied withfighting the war on terror and in theprocessevery Arab relief agency is labeled as a tool for AlQaeda Hamas or Hezbollah.
But putting politics aside this is a straight forward issue. International law prohibits the boarding of vessels in international waters. Attacking a relief ship in this manner is as illegal as engaging inpiracyoff of the coast of Somalia.
Some argue that Israel has the right to enforce the embargo and make certain that humanitarian shipments into Gaza do not include weapons.This may sound good butit presupposes that the embargo is legal.The siege of Gaza is wrong and severely punishes Palestinians by depriving them of food medical supplies and basic services. TheU.N.told Israel to end the embargoin the first place.
International law also requires that onlyproportionalforce may be used in the face of violent resistance. Yes the commandos were met with violence when they illegally boarded the vessel on the high seas.You can see this clearly in the video. But shooting protesters in the head with automatic weapons is not proportional or morally defensible particularly when the commandos had no right to board the ship in the first place.
The local news media is reporting that Royal Caribbean recently received a bomb threataboard theLiberty of the Seas cruise ship.
There have been a number of bomb threat hoaxes recently. Perhaps themost publicized one was when a passenger from VirginianamedIbrahim Khalil Zarou who was reportedly quite intoxicated Bomb Hoax Gets Drunken Carnival Cruise Passenger Arrested
Fortunately these bomb threats turned out to be hoaxes. But what if they were real
In this most recent bomb threat the FBI and other federal agencies did not board the cruise ship until eleven hours later.
Are cruise lines equipped to handle a real terrorist threat on the high seas Most cruise lines have as few as or security guards on duty at night and some lines do not monitor their surveillance camerasexcept in the casinos. Is this adequate security for to passengers and crew
Our experiencesuggeststhat the few security personnel on cruise shipshave a difficult enough time deterring or responding to bar fights between drunken passengers. A realterrorist threat on the high seas will pose a real problemto the cruise industry.

OTTAWA Six Canadians died in an attack on a luxury hotel in Burkina Faso Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday as the Quebec government confirmed all six were from Quebec.
Four jihadist attackers linked to alQaida were killed by Burkina Faso and French security forces hours after they stormed the Splendid Hotel and nearby Cappuccino Cafe in Ouagadougou establishments popular with westerners in the West African countrys capital.
At least died in the attacks from different countries in the attack on the Splendid Hotel and nearby Cappuccino Cafe establishments popular with westerners in Ouagadougou.
Trudeau issued a statement strongly condemning the attack that began late Friday and ended Saturday.
On behalf of all Canadians we offer our deepest condolences to the families friends and colleagues of all those killed and a speedy recovery to all those injured. We are deeply saddened by these senseless acts of violence on innocent civilians Trudeausaid in the statement.
The statement did not give any information on the identities of the Canadians. The federal government is normally prohibited from providing such information due to privacy laws. But a representative from the Department of Global Affairs was able to confirm that no staff of the Canadian government were killed.
A spokesperson for Quebecs International Relations Minister Christine StPierre has confirmed the six were all from Quebec.
Three attackers were killed at the hotel and a fourth was killed when security forces cleared out a second hotel nearby. Two of the three attackers at the Splendid Hotel were identified as female President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said on national radio.
He says at least hostages were freed in part by French forces who arrived overnight from neighbouring Mali to aid in the rescue.
The attack was launched by the same extremists behind a similar siege at an upscale hotel in Bamako Mali in November that left dead.
Burkina Faso a largely Muslim country had for years been largely spared from the violence carried out by Islamic extremist groups who were abducting foreigners for ransom in neighbouring Mali and Niger. Then last April a Romanian national was kidnapped in an attack that was the first of its kind in the country.
Canada and Burkina Faso have had a diplomatic relationship since according to the Department of Global Affairs adding that Canada is the countrys largest foreign investor.
In addition to trading about million in goods and importing another . million in the fiscal year Canada provided million for development assistance in Burkina Faso that same year.
An alQaida affiliate known as alQaida in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility online as the attack was ongoing in downtown Ouagadougou at the room hotel according to the SITE Intelligence Group.
A New York judge has sentenced Osama bin Ladens soninlaw and alQaida spokesman to life in prison for his conviction in a terrorism case.

Recent terror attacks in California and Paris have all of us talking about security in public places but there is one vulnerable target in Boston and throughout the Northeast that is potentially being overlooked.
Its just before sunrise at South Station and already theres a reminder of the threat of terrorism.
Armed Homeland Security Police officers are in the station making an unannounced inspection.
They are part of a Transportation Security Administration VIPR team which stands for Visual Intermodal Prevention and Response and they are working with Amtrak Police and their bomb sniffing dogs looking for suspicious behavior and explosives. Each officer is carrying a radiation detector.
This periodic security operation which takes place unannounced at train stations all over New England and the rest of country raises an important question.
How likely is it that there will be a terrorist attack here in the U.S. on a train
We have to expect it. Thats the bottom line said Sean Burke head of the Center for Resilience Studies at Northeastern University and a former Homeland Security official.
Train attacks are happening overseas and Burke said there is nothing in place to guarantee it wont happen here.
The passenger rail system is designed to be open Burke said. Its specifically put in densely populated areas. Its a system that is vulnerable really from the beginning of its trip to the end of its trip.
There is open access to the station everywhere you look. There are no check points security lines or baggage checks like there are in airports. And passengers dont even have to present identification before they board just a ticket.
The entire Amtrak system encompasses more than miles of unprotected tracks and the rail line between Boston and Washington DC the Northeast Corridor carries the majority of Amtraks passengers.
That is the heart and soul or our rail system in the U.S. said Congressman Stephen Lynch DMA who has studied many of the terrorist attacks on trains around the world since .
If the terrorists were trying to disrupt and quote terrorize that would be a prime target of those individuals Lynch said. When you see there are rail attacks in France or Russia or Japan or Spain or Britain that should be a message to us.It is estimated that five times as many people ride the rail system as fly in airplanes every year nationwide and experts say if you tried to install airport style security and screening in train stations it would bring the entire rail system to a screeching halt.
A Inspector Generals report criticized how Amtrak and the Department of Homeland Security were spending security money concluding the traveling public remains at risk for a potential terrorist attack at Amtraks highrisk stations.
We need our security officials to be frank about the issue that the Department of Homeland Security our first responders theyre not always going to be able to keep us safe said Burke.
Like on the train in France this past summer when it took the courageous acts of three American passengers to subdue an armed terrorist.
They are the first line of defense Burke said. It is every day citizens who are inevitably going to be the first responders.
A spokeswoman for Amtrak Police said the agency has partnerships with dozens of law enforcement agencies around the country and even employs two of its own intelligence analysts to assess and help respond to terrorist threats.
In addition Burke told us that private companies are in the process of developing new technologies to scan trains for explosives and chemicals before they are boarded.
Congressman Lynch is planning to host a rail security summit early next year the details of which are still being worked out.

Details of several Paris shootings are currently emerging amid fears that a possible terrorist attack may have been orchestrated in the French capital.
Thus far more than people perhaps at many as may have died in the Paris shootings reported Associated Press. A potential terrorist motivation has not yet been confirmed or ruled out though French citizens are obviously fearful of the possibility given the bloody attack on the offices of French satire paper Charlie Hebdo earlier this year that claimed lives.
President Francois Hollande has officially declared a state of emergency and closed the borders of France. These are one of several indications that officials are not ruling out that the Paris shooting were indeed a coordinated terrorist attack. While addressing the nation the president stood firm against the violent incidents.
What the terrorists want is to make us scared to terrify us. But facing terror is a country that knows how to defend itself.
Due to widespread uncertainty about whether or not the possible Paris terrorist attack has ended French citizens are taking to social media to offer an Open Door policy for anyone who may be seeking shelter in the city. Using the hashtag PorteOuverte Parisian are tweeting out locations that are safe for both tourists and locals alike to find hiding.
Tweet to PorteOuverte if you need a safe place to stay tonight. My love to everyone in Paris PrayersParis
Were in Le Marais PorteOuverte. Cant get back to our hotel by Arc De Triomphe. In a bar presently for warmth but feels wrong being here.
Local theater Bataclan is reportedly the site of an ongoing hostage situation related to the Paris shootings. American rock band Eagles of Death Metal were playing at the venue and it is reported by CNN that around hostages are currently trapped inside. Victims trapped in the Bataclan are saying that seven to eight people are under control of the attackers who are currently battling it out with the local police force.
Another incident took place at a Germany Vs. France world championship soccer game at the Stade de France. Present at the match was President Francois Hollande who was subsequently moved to the Interior Ministry. Several explosions reportedly took place at the scene. One was reportedly audible in the live video coverage of the match.
Some of the clashes related to the Paris shooting took place inside of crowded restaurants. Another took place at the local Les Halles shopping mall. In at least one of the violent moments police were nearby to respond to the call. Unidentified video and photos are currently surfacing on social media.
President Barack Obama has just made a public statement in support of the Parisian community in light of the shooting. Despite clear confirmation that a terrorist attack did in fact take place the president has pledged his support to the French community reported CNN.
This is an attack not just on Paris not just on France but an attack on humanity and all of the universal values that we uphold.
Look for further Inquisitr articles for more updates about the Paris shooting and its status as a terrorist attack.

TV Judge Greg Mathis believes if the emails circulated between members of Gov. Snyders administration about lead levels in the City of Flint Michigans water indicate that someone either fraudulently or misrepresented the facts that they knew to be untrue then yes it is criminal.
JudgeMathis also explained that if the water crisis was a direct result of gross negligence criminal charges could be filed against those involved.
Mathis told Roland Martin host of NewsOne Now that Gov. Snyder should certainly resign.
You know we hear this personal responsibility among the Republicans quite frankly the conservative crowd Black youth Black families have to take personal responsibility for their actions well lets see some personal responsibility here by resigning Judge Mathis said.
Mathis went so far as to liken the poisoning of Flint to a terrorist attack saying Everyday our Homeland Security their biggest fear and preparation is for terrorists poisoning the water. The Secretary of Defense talks nervously about that well in this instance our government has poisoned the water and its causing permanent damage.

France was rocked by another terror attack Sunday night and another a few days earlier. The mentally deranged extremists shouted Allahu Akbar while committing acts of terror described as lone wolf attacks. But theres a reason you probably wont hear very much about this one from mainstream media.
In total people have been seriously injured in Dijon the site of the attack. Fortunately no lives are in danger of being lost but that doesnt change the fact that three lone wolf terrorists attempted to kill as many infidels as possible. The main perpetrator of the attack attempted to flee the scene while shouting Allahu Akbar
The Sunday attack comes only one day after a French man armed with a knife stormed a police station at JouelesTours near the city of Tours. He managed to stab three police officers also reportedly shouting Allahu Akbar The attacker was shot dead by police. A gun was able to save the lives of police officers when used against a terrorist armed with a knife.
The terror attack Sunday night happened when the lone wolves first hit pedestrians and then crashed into a crowd of with a car reports Le Bien Republic. No gun was used to perpetrate this horrifying terror attack or the attack at the police station. No shots were fired and guns are still banned in France. Not one news outlet is blaming the car. The weapon of choice cannot be blamed in order to promote a particular political agenda.
Car drove into crowds in different locations in the DijonFranceScreaming Allahu Akbar injured seriously pic.twitter.comWZJuQiUc
Once the attempted killing began and the driver bailed from the car two other terrorists also jumped from the vehicle. Witnesses also claim the driver was screaming that he was acting for the Children of Palestine.
The hypocrites cannot focus on these particular terrorist attacks because they are unable to stand on bodies of the dead because there are none thanks to a gun while claiming moral superiority and the need to ban guns. They cannot make a point that guns are bad when a gun played no role in either attack except to stop the knifewielding terrorist. The only thing to blame here would be Islam and we know the liberal left and their lapdog media isnt going to do that.
President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned yesterdays terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club Orlando Florida describing it as criminal and cowardly. 
In a letter to the Ambassador of the United States in Nigeria James Entwistle President Buhari conveyed Nigerias heartfelt sympathy to President Barrack Obama and the people of United States of America. 
The President in a statement signed by Femi Adesina Special Adviser to the President Media Publicity also assured the United States of Nigerias continued support and cooperation in the fight against terrorism. 
President Buhari extends his most sincere condolences to the families relatives and friends of the victims. 
The President condemns such criminal cowardly attack wherever it might occur as an attack on all decent democratic peaceful people. 
Every terrorist attack only strengthens Nigerias resolve to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States and other countries in the frontline of the war on terror the letter which was signed by the Chief of Staff to the President Abba Kyari read. 
President Buhari also called on all peaceloving nations to commit themselves wholeheartedly to multilateral cooperation and collaborative actions aimed at eradicating the scourge of international terrorism.

With extras on hand and fake car bombs going off it could have been a film shoot. Instead the city of Cannes Thursday morning conducted a simulation of coordinated terror attacks designed to test emergency responders ahead of the annual film festival next month.
The fake explosion rocked the citys Palais and was followed by four armed terrorists forcing their way up the Palais grand entrance where the red carpet will be rolled out in just three weeks. Local schools also participated with security drills that would come into play in case of a terror attack.
The extras were lying injured in red vests along the Croisette and splayed across the steps of the Palais.
The simulations were the first of their kind put in place to test out the citys new security protocols following the Charlie Hebdo attacks last January and theLe Bataclan attacks in November in Paris.
You have to be prepared for what we consider a multiterror event not only in one place and not only in one hour in a few places over a few hours security consultant Nitzan Nuriel who was hired by the city to take part in a city security audit told The Hollywood Reporter.
The simulation involved not only local police but the national police and gendarmerie as well as firefighters EMTs hospital workers and doctors who would be first responders in this type of attack. Video of the simulation later surfaced online and can be seen below.
With multiple locations most of the security forces will be very very busy and need to go from one place to another and will probably not be able to take care of all the peoples immediate needs Nuriel said.
One has to be prepared in case the worst occurs Mayor David Lisnard told THR.
Therefore we hold these reallife rehearsals in case of attacks in the hotels in the Palais in the schools but its above all a simulation a test run in case of necessity.
Lisnard initiated a review of the citys security protocol last November and brought on a panel to assess the citys security from city properties and people to cyber security. Its rather innovative for a city he added.
The simulation was initiated by the Interior Ministry. Security staff will review Thursdays exercise and decide if other protocols need to be introduced ahead of the festival when more than people descend on the tiny town.
The intent is to be immediately on the ground and know what to do said Nuriel. The most important thing is to make sure that we have the knowhow the capability and are fully trained to take the responsibility if something should happen.
Since last Januarys Charlie Hebdo attacks the country has been operating under the Vigipirate protocol a nationwide security alert that has made bag checks and metal detectors mandatory at movie theaters among other things.
As part of this new protocol the Palaismoved the perimeter away from the building and blocked the immediate entrance from the doors for major events. All entrants are subject to bag checks and wanding by handheld metal detectors before being allowed through metal gates.
The French government has confirmed the killing of a couple who were both police officers was a terror attack.
Larossi Abbala stabbed a French police commander to death outside his home on Monday night and pledged allegiance to socalled Islamic State. 
The officers partner was later found dead. The couples threeyearold son survived the attack.
The Paris prosecutor said searches of Abballas home uncovered a list of targets including rappers journalists police officers and public personalities.

Pakistani volunteers carry a student injured in the shootout at a school under attack by Taliban gunmen at a local hospital in Peshawar Pakistan Tuesday. Mohammad SajjadAssociated Press 
The burnedout buildings dotted the landscape of Pakistans Talibancontrolled Swat Valley as veteran Canadian aid worker David Morley drove the bumpy roads with a local aid worker more than three years ago.
This used to be a boys school that used to be a girls school that used to be a clinic Morley recalled his Pakistani colleague telling him.
Morley the head of the United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF in Canada did not mince words Tuesday as news emerged of the suicide attack that killed at least people the vast majority of them children at a school in Peshawar the Pakistani city abutting the Khyber Pass leading to Afghanistan.
This is a crime against humanity and its against civilized norms because we want to nurture and care for our children Morley said in an interview.
We want them to learn and educate and this is heinous act against all of those norms.
The attack sparked similar condemnation in Canada and abroad. Many viewed it as a new low in the behaviour of Taliban terrorists who took responsibility for the attack.
Students ranging from Grade through Grade accounted for most of the dead. They were killed along with their seven attackers all of whom were wearing explosive suicide vests. Another students and three staff members were injured.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his condolences to the families of the victims. Its hard enough to understand the motives that underlie a terrorist attack he said but even more so when the targets are innocent children.
Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird has condemned the attack on the school which he called cowardly and sinister. Hasan JamaliAssociated Press
Its hard for any of us as rational and compassionate people to understand terrorism to understand why people would want in the name of some political cause to simply terrorize hurt kill innocent people whole sections of society Harper told a news conference in Quebec City.
But I think it is beyond our comprehension why somebody would target children. As a father your heart just breaks when you see that kind of thing.
Harper also acknowledged the attack Monday in Australia where three people including the lone gunman a selfstyled cleric with jihadist sympathies died after a hour hostagetaking at a cafe in Sydney.
Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said he was sickened by the news of the Peshawar attack and urged Pakistanis to draw strength from one of their own the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai.
The teenager survived being shot in the head by gunmen two years ago while boarding a busto school in Pakistans Swat region and has become a symbol of defiance to terrorists who try to prevent children from going to school.
In the moments that follow such harrowing tragedy we hope that the resolve and the dignity of innocent Pakistani people will see more children like Malala Yousafzai emerge to carry the torch forward for more education free from violence or intimidation Baird said in a statement.
There is no more cowardly act than attacking innocent children and nothing more sinister than brutally murdering them while at school.
NDP Leader Tom Mulcair said Tuesdays attack makes Yousafzais work more vital than ever.
As we grieve the loss of these innocent lives we are reminded that education is a powerful threat to extremism everywhere he said in the statement while offering his condolences.
For longtime Canadian aid workers who have witnessed decades of suffering firsthand Tuesdays attack marked a new low.
What we all have to do is refrain from immediately responding in anger and violence because that just feeds into it that makes it a spiral said Morley of UNICEF whose career started years ago working with street children in Central America.
But right now is time for mourning for those poor children and their families.
Dave Toycen the head of World Vision Canada said violence against children leaves a lasting impact on survivors causing mental health problems that prevent them from learning and leading productive lives.
Children should be safe in places where they live and learn. Schools should not be battlegrounds.
As he was about to open a session of the United Nations Security Council UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon condemned the rank cowardice of the attack and said schools should be safe places for learning.
Getting an education is every childs right said Ban. Going to school should not have to be an act of bravery.
Yousafzai who came to embody that bravery expressed heartbreak and defiance on Tuesday in a statement she issued on social media.
I condemn these atrocious and cowardly acts and stand united with the government and armed forces of Pakistan whose efforts so far to address this horrific event are commendable she said.
I along with millions of others around the world mourn these children my brothers and sisters but we will never be defeated.
Yousafzai has been given honorary Canadian citizenship which Harper was to have bestowed on her in October during a ceremony in Toronto.
It was cancelled however because that was the day another lone gunman shot and killed a soldier standing guard at the National War Memorial before storming Parliament Hill where he was shot to death by security guards.

OTTAWA Six Canadians died in an attack on a luxury hotel in Burkina Faso Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday as the Quebec government confirmed all six were from Quebec.
Four jihadist attackers linked to alQaida were killed by Burkina Faso and French security forces hours after they stormed the Splendid Hotel and nearby Cappuccino Cafe in Ouagadougou establishments popular with westerners in the West African countrys capital.
At least died in the attacks from different countries in the attack on the Splendid Hotel and nearby Cappuccino Cafe establishments popular with westerners in Ouagadougou.
Trudeau issued a statement strongly condemning the attack that began late Friday and ended Saturday.
On behalf of all Canadians we offer our deepest condolences to the families friends and colleagues of all those killed and a speedy recovery to all those injured. We are deeply saddened by these senseless acts of violence on innocent civilians Trudeausaid in the statement.
The statement did not give any information on the identities of the Canadians. The federal government is normally prohibited from providing such information due to privacy laws. But a representative from the Department of Global Affairs was able to confirm that no staff of the Canadian government were killed.
A spokesperson for Quebecs International Relations Minister Christine StPierre has confirmed the six were all from Quebec.
Three attackers were killed at the hotel and a fourth was killed when security forces cleared out a second hotel nearby. Two of the three attackers at the Splendid Hotel were identified as female President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said on national radio.
He says at least hostages were freed in part by French forces who arrived overnight from neighbouring Mali to aid in the rescue.
The attack was launched by the same extremists behind a similar siege at an upscale hotel in Bamako Mali in November that left dead.
Burkina Faso a largely Muslim country had for years been largely spared from the violence carried out by Islamic extremist groups who were abducting foreigners for ransom in neighbouring Mali and Niger. Then last April a Romanian national was kidnapped in an attack that was the first of its kind in the country.
Canada and Burkina Faso have had a diplomatic relationship since according to the Department of Global Affairs adding that Canada is the countrys largest foreign investor.
In addition to trading about million in goods and importing another . million in the fiscal year Canada provided million for development assistance in Burkina Faso that same year.
An alQaida affiliate known as alQaida in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility online as the attack was ongoing in downtown Ouagadougou at the room hotel according to the SITE Intelligence Group.

Just as the new book by former Defense Secretary Bob Gates confirmed what many believed that President Obama was a politically motivated commanderinchief who had no faith in an Afghan surge he put Americans in harms way to execute transcripts of congressional testimony by military leaders confirm that President Obama knew Benghazi was a terrorist attack before he went to bed to rest for a Las Vegas fundraising trip.
Ham said he immediately contacted Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey to say he was coming down the hall at the Pentagon to meet with him.
I told him what I knew. We immediately walked upstairs to meet with Secretary Panetta Ham testified adding they had the basic information as they headed across for the meeting at the White House.
Rep. Brad Wenstrup ROhio an Iraq war veteran and Army reserve officer asked year Army veteran Ham what he told Panetta and Dempsey. As a military person I am concerned that someone in the military would be advising that this was a demonstration. I would hope that our military leadership would be advising that this was a terrorist attack Wenstrup said.
Ham responded that there was some preliminary discussion about you know maybe there was a demonstration. But I think at the command I personally and I think the command very quickly got to the point that this was not a demonstration this was a terrorist attack and that was the nature of the conversation Ham had with Panetta and Dempsey moments before their minute meeting with President Obama.
This confirms Panettas testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in February of last year that it was he who told the president there was an apparent attack going on in Benghazi.
Secretary Panetta do you believe that unequivocally at that time we knew that this was a terrorist attack asked Sen. Jim Inhofe ROkla.
There was no question in my mind that this was a terrorist attack Panetta replied.
Despite a briefing by Dempsey and Panetta that it was a terrorist attack President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would trumpet the false narrative that four Americans were murdered due to an inflammatory video something Obama would repeat six times before the U.N. General Assembly and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice would say on five Sunday talk shows five days after the terrorist attack.
It is a disgrace that the only person ever jailed for the Benghazi attack was the maker of that irrelevant video. The terrorists got away with it.
President Obama and Secretary Clinton were complicit in a lie designed to protect the presidents reelection chances a few months later and Hillary Clintons presidential ambitions in .
What difference does it make Well the difference between the truth and a lie can mean saving or losing lives or losing or winning an election especially if the lie comes from the White House.

Gurdaspur InMyOpinion ISI LashkareTaiba LeT Pakistan Punjab Terror Attack Yakub Memon 
Speculations are rife that the militants belonged to LashkareTaiba LeT outfit and had the backing of Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence ISI. Even former intelligence officials are not ready to rule out a possible link between Yakub Memons hanging and the terror attack.
However according to the Punjab police and the central intelligence sources its too early to say anything with conviction about the attack that had cost seven lives four policemen including SP Detective Baljeet Singh and three civilians. The three militants who had stormed into a police station at Dinanager kms from Gurdaspur city on NH in the early hours of Monday and took to indiscriminate firing were also killed in the siege.
The central intelligence has claimed that an alert was sent to the Punjab government about a possible terror attack which was ignored. The attack has been dubbed an intelligence failure.
The Gurdaspur attack is the biggest terror attack in the Punjab in more than a decade. The choice of Gurdaspur as a terror target has come as a surprise not only for the Punjab but for the entire country.
According to intelligence sources the geographical location of Gurdaspur probably made it an ideal target. The Gurdaspur district is the northern most district of Punjab and lies between river Ravi and Beas. It is km from the international border of India and Pakistan. Gurdaspurs close proximity to the border has also made it a hotbed of drug trafficking.
Counterterrorism analyst Anil Kamboj said Investigations would reveal the actual cause of attack on Gurdaspur. But prima facie modus operandi indicates that there could be a possibility that due to heavy security in Jammu Kashmir especially due to the Amarnath Yatra the militants who are unable to create disturbance there headed kms southward to Gurdaspur and attacked. Due to high security alert by multiple security agencies across JK and at the borders these militants might have got inside Punjab sometime back and used Pathankot as their hideout. Moreover Gurdaspur was relatively an easy target for the militants due to its close proximity to the border and attracted lesser attention of the security forces in comparison to other districts like Amritsar.
As Gurdaspur is so close to the IndiaPakistan border it became an obvious choice for the terrorists from the other side to enter the city and attack. Its a shocking incident for us but Gurdaspur wont allow anymore Khalistan militancy to thrive. Were already fighting the drug menace in the district aggravated by smuggling from across the border. This attack will cast a shadow over IndiaPakistan peace efforts a government doctor of Gurdaspur told Firstpost on condition of anonymity.
The intelligence agencies have claimed the attackers to be militants from PakistanISI backed terror outfit possibly the LeT.
Defence analyst Maj Gen retd Dhruv C Katoch opined Pakistans ISI has been trying to cause disturbances on Indian soil for quite some time. The militants had threatened to unleash attack during the Amarnath Yatra but due to heavy security deployment they diverted it on Gurdaspur and thereby sent a message about their presence. But the terror attack in Gurdaspur also reveals a possibility of a tacit support from sleeper cells of proKhalistani elements. The worst was that the militants were in army uniform that eased their way into a police station. Once the investigation reveals the perpetrators of the crime appropriate response mechanism needs to be implemented.
Meanwhile Lieutenant General retd KS Brar who headed the Indian Armys Operation Blue Star to flush out Khalistani militants from the Golden Temple in has reportedly blamed the Punjab government and ISI for the terror attack. He criticised the Punjab government of taking a soft stand towards Khalistani terror groups and releasing them as a part of vote bank politics.
There is an uncanny resemblance between the modus operandi of Mumbai attackers and the three terrorists who had entered Gurdaspur city by snatching a car and indiscriminately killing whosoever they found right from a roadside vendor to policemen.
According to Kamboj the modus operandi of the attack shows it couldnt be the work of proKhalistani militants but that of a Pakbased terror group like in the case of Mumbai attack. Its a Fidayeentype of attack usually undertaken by LeT operatives unlike the Khalistani militants who opted for direct ambush. These militants were wellequipped with GPS grenades and arms and unleashed a sudden and unexpected attack by firing on a moving bus and on the citizens including a woman attendant of a patient. They even planted five IEDs on a railway track which fortunately didnt blowoff.
Kambojs claim finds support inwhat a Punjab Police source said We heard the terrorists shout AllahOAkbar In Arabic its God is great from inside the house where they had taken shelter. They may be from Pakistan.
According to counterterrorism analysts and former intelligence officials the possible motive behind the attack could be an attempt to revive militancy in the Punjab on one hand to protesting the upcoming capital punishment to Yakub Memon scheduled to take place on July.
If Tiger Memon had been instrumental in carrying out the Mumbai serial blast at the behest of ISI dont you think its a kind of payback from the ISI using militants to show that if you hang our people well kill yours. Though its too early to claim this theory it cant be ruled outoutright a former Intelligence Bureau IB official said on condition of anonymity.
Kamboj who had served in the Punjab during its peak militancy period added The attack could be an attempt to revive militancy in Punjab. By unleashing a terror attack in Gurdaspur the Pakbased militants have tried to give message to proKhalistan sympathizers and hardliners that a revival was possible. After all many top leaders of the Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Movement are enjoying hospitality by living in Pakistan under ISIs patronage.
Added Katoch The ISI would also like to destabilise India due to the latters growing importance on the global platform and the strengthening of its economy.
Reacting to the attack Brar said the ISI has been trying to revive Khalistani terror groups. Pakistani intelligence agency wants to take the Punjab back to what it was in the s while the state government has been weak. It is very disturbing to terrorists have come across the border. This is unfortunate that so many terrorists came unnoticed. It is the failure of the state government. The terrorists should have been rounded up Brar told a news channel.

CNSNews.com More than six years after a Muslim army major shot dead people at Fort Hood President Obama on Sunday night for what may be the first time publicly identified it as a terrorist attack.
In his primetime Oval Office address on the threat of terrorism in the wake of last weeks attack in San Bernardino California Obama said the threat had evolved in the years since .
As weve become better at preventing complex attacks like terrorists turn to less complicated acts of violence like the mass shootings that are all too common in our society he said. It is this type of attack that we saw at Fort Hood in in Chattanooga earlier this year and now in San Bernardino.
The administration long shied away from calling Major Nidal Malik Hasans killing of people at Fort Hood Texas an act of terrorism the deadliest on U.S. soil since until last weeks attack in San Bernardino set a new grim milestone and the Pentagon categorized it as workplace violence.
In a presidential proclamation honoring the victims Obama referred only to the tragic events at Fort Hood and when he delivered a eulogy at the base days later he did not use the word terrorist.The closest he came in that speech to identifying the cause that drove Hasan was the statement that no faith justifies these murderous and craven acts no just and loving God looks upon them with favor.
The Obama administration was criticized for not calling Fort Hood an act of terror even though a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs investigation called it in a report the deadliest terrorist attack within the United States since September .
One Washington Times editorial called the White House response to the attack a textbook study in denial and coverup.
The Obama administration refused to admit it was a terrorist attack calling it instead an example of violence in the workplace it said. Radical Islam is the hatred that dare not speak its name.
During his trial Hasan a former Army psychiatrist said he acted in defense of the Taliban. He was sentenced to death by a military jury in for the attack and is imprisoned on military death row in Fort Leavenworth Kansas.
Military personnel among those killed and wounded by him were disqualified from receiving the Purple Heart since eligibility required death or injury by an attacker acting at the direction of a foreign terrorist organization.
Congress then passed legislation changing the criteria to cover instances where an attacker was in contact with foreign terrorists before an attack and was inspired by the foreign group paving the way early this year for a decision to award Purple Hearts and the equivalent civilian medal to civilian victims.
In a review of the Fort Hood incident and the new provisions of law the Army determined that there was sufficient evidence to conclude Hasan was in communication with the foreign terrorist organization before the attack and that his radicalization and subsequent acts could reasonably be considered to have been inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization the Pentagon said last February.
Hasan was found to have communicated on numerous occasions with the YemeniAmerican cleric and alQaeda propagandist Anwar alAwlaki. Awlaki was killed in a Sept. drone strike in Yemen.
Until his Oval Office address on Sunday the nearest Obama is believed to have come to acknowledging publicly if indirectly that the Fort Hood attacks was terrorism occurred during a joint press appearance with French President Francois Hollande last month following the Paris terror attacks.
The good news is Americans are resilient Obama said then. We mourned the lives lost at Fort Hood the Boston Marathon at Chattanooga. But we did not waver. Our communities have come together.
The Chattanooga attack Obama referenced in both his Oval Office address on Sunday and alongside Hollande last month took place last July when a gunman identified as Muhammad Abdulazeez shot and killed four Marines at a Navy operations support center before being killed himself. A fifth victim a sailor died of his wounds two days later.
The administration initially did not classify that attack as terrorism either. Obama on the night of the shooting asked Americans to await more facts and did not use the word terrorism.
But the FBI said from the outset it was investigating the case as an act of terrorism and at a eulogy for the victims a month later VicePresident Joe Biden called the killer a perverted jihadist.
The San Bernardino killers were Syed Rizwan Farook the U.S.born son of Pakistani migrants and his Pakistaniborn wife Tafsheen Malik.

Issuing a statement hours after the attacks Egypts top Muslim authority alAzhar strongly condemned the blasts saying these heinous crimes violate the tolerant teachings of Islam.
The Cairobased body urged the international community to confront the epidemic of terrorism sayingIf the international community does not unite to confront this epidemic the corrupt will not stop from committing heinous crimes against the innocent.
In a separate development and in reaction to the terrorist attacks in Belgiums capital the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah said Europe is being burnt by same fire lit in Syria and Middle East by some regimes.
The fire that Europe in particular and the world in general is being burnt by is the same one that some regimes ignited in Syria and other states in the region Hezbollah said in a statement issued to condemnthe attacks.
Meanwhile Syriasstate news agency SANA said the Syriangovernment condemns Brussels attacks which are the result of wrong policies on terrorism.
Speaking at a press conference in Jordans capital Amman European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the Brussels blasts marked a very sad day for Europe as Europe and its capital is suffering the same pain that this region has known and knows every single day.
She added that it was already clear that the Belgium blasts were attacks that stemmed from radicalization and called for European and Middle Eastern leaders to work together to tackle the scourge.
We are still waiting for more precise news on the dynamics of the attacks in Brussels but it is quite clear the roots of the pain we are suffering around our region are very much the same Mogherini said addingWe are united in not only suffering. but also reacting to these acts and preventing radicalization and violence together.
NATOs Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also commented on the incidents in Brussels saying thatthe explosions that ripped through Brussels airport and a city metro station mark a dark day.
French President Francois Hollande also issued an statement on Tuesday sayingthat the attacks in Brussels struck at the whole of Europe.
Through the attacks in Brussels the whole of Europe has been hit Hollande said urging the continent to take vital steps in the face of the seriousness of the threat.
In a separate development German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the Brussels attacks appeared to be aimed not just at Belgium but at the entire European Union and its freedoms.
It seems that the clear targets of the attacks an international airport a metro station close to EU institutions indicate that this terrorist attack is not aimed solely against Belgium but against our freedom freedom of movement mobility and everyone in the EU de Maiziere told a news conference in Berlin.
British Prime Minister David Cameron has also condemned the appalling attacks in Brussels and urged European countries to stand together against the threat of terrorism.
We will never let these terrorists win Cameron said after an emergency cabinet meeting in London.
He added We face a very real terrorist threat right across the different countries of Europe and we have to meet that with everything we have.
The British premier said his country would absolutely stand with Belgium at this very difficult time.
Meanwhile both Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and President Recep Tayyip Erdogans spokesmanstrongly condemned the Brussels attacks.
I condemn the attack. It shows once again the face of global terrorism that took place in Brussels this morning and I express my condolences to the government and people of Belgium Davutoglu said.
He once again invited humankind to act together against every kind of terrorism including the Kurdistan Workers Party PKK the Revolutionary Peoples Liberation PartyFront known as the DHKPC and the Daesh Takfiri group.
Secretary General of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council Abdullatif alZayani said in a statement that the sixnation body offered its support to Belgium
The bloc comprises Saudi Arabia Kuwait Bahrain Oman Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
Tuesday bomb attacks at Brussels airport killed people and left more than wounded a spokesman for the fire services told AFP.
There are wounded and dead. These figures are likely to change we hope to have complete figures by this evening the spokesman added.
Meanwhile alocal Brussels mayor said a separate bombing in a metro station killed around people and injured .

Terrorism hit the Atataturk airport in Istanbul last night as three suicide bombers exploded powerful devices that killed and injured a large number of people. The rising number of victims is currently dead and injured. ISIS is suspected as inspiring or directing the attack.
Cable news repeatedly showed frightening images of massive explosions in a transit lounge as well as a gunman running into the airport shooting a AK assault weapon who then is shot by airport security and drops his weapon only to blow his suicide vest up as he lies on the floor.
This latest attack comes on the heels of previous terrorist attacks in Turkey including two prior attacks in Istanbul this year including a car bomb earlier this month and a suicide bomber earlier this year as well as deadly car bombs in Ankara this year which doubtlessly will have the effect of frightening people from traveling or cruising to Turkey.
A number of newspapers have recently reported that the two terrorists attacks last year in Tunisiawhich killed cruise passengers from Costa and MSC cruise ships at the Bardo Museum in Tunis and later several dozens of British tourists on holiday at beach resorts in Sousse Tunisia is causing the countrys tourism industry to struggle. Skift reports that Tunisian tourist revenue was down percent last year at . billion and caused the dinar currency to historic lows against the dollar and euro this month.
This is bad news for the future of tourism in Turkey. There have been at least eight terror attacks in Turkey dating back a year. USA TODAY today published an article today which notes that the string of attacks have caused a big drop in tourism a major source of revenue for Turkey. Many cruise ships that used to make port calls in Istanbul are bypassing the city.
The CruiseArabia website says that justtwo international cruise ships were in Turkish waters at the time of the attack Tuesday both Wind Star and Royal Caribbeans Jewel of the Seas have continued with their cruise itineraries as planned.
At the time of writing Jewel of the Seas was in port in Kusudasi while Wind Star was anchored off Bodrum. Both Windstar Cruises and Royal Caribbean have refused to comment on whether any additional security has been put in place for passengers on shore excursions in the wake of the attacks.
Theres no question that cruising to Europe seems to be lagging behind cruises to other locations which are perceived to be safer like the Caribbean.We all know from comments by the cruise executives at Royal Caribbean following its last quarter that Americans Are Cruising Closer to U.S. Waters due to the terrorist activities in Paris and Brussels. 
The number one location that we are asked about is Turkey. To respond to such inquiries we mention prior terrorist attacks there and the issue of immigrants from Syria and other countries but the reader has to make up their own mind whether it is reasonably safe based on their own risk assessment.
But its naive to think that cruising to the Caribbean is safer than cruising to Europe. I can readily say that cruising to the Caribbean will take you to some of the most dangerous ports of call in the world not from terrorists mind you but from common criminals. Some of the Caribbean ports have a lot of crime and high murder rates which make cruising to Nassau St. Thomas and Roatan like cruising to East St. Louis Baltimore and Detroit except most U.S. citizens dont know any better. Europe is far safer than the Caribbean in terms of rape murder harassment and theft.
Most experts seems to say its just a matter of when and where not if ISIS will attack. The highly respected gCaptain reported yesterday that Captain William Nault Chief of Staff with the multinational Combined Maritime Forces CMF told Reutersthat Al Qaedas Yemen branch remains a powerful force and poses a growing risk to ships. 
We have seen other dontworryaboutathing articles from travel writers before likethe article in the Telegraph in February Are Cruise Holidays Safe from Terrorism written by U.K. cruise travel specialist Jane Archer who appeared to us to ignore history and downplay the threat of terror.
Chances are remote of course that you will be attacked by terrorists when you cruise in or around Europe. The chances of being a victim of crime in the Caribbean are greater. But as far as cruises in either part of the world you certainly arent nuts if you decide to vacation somewhere else this summer.
Stephen L. Caldwella member of the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee. downplayed the threat of international radical Islamic terrorism on the cruise industry in an article for Maritime Executive entitled Tightening the Security Envelope Despite all the hoopla about terrorist threats and onboard crime cruise ships are among the safest places on earth. He suggests that talk of terrorism is much ado about nothing. I posted Mr.Caldwells articleon our Facebook page with the comment thatif the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security is listening to this committee on international maritime security matters passengers are sitting ducks.
My view is that Mr. Caldwells naive article might as well have been written by the Cruise Line International Association for PR purposes. It is dangerously irresponsible to crew members and cruise passengers alike. I have expressed my feelings here about the threat of ISIS on cruise shipping many times before includingHow the Next Jihadist Terror Attack Against Cruise Passengers Will Happen.
He estimates that the chance that ISIS will attack blue water objectives out of sight of land is still remote as long as navies of the world continue to provide a credible presence on the oceans. However coastal attacks like that committed by ISIS predecessor Al Qaeda againstthe USS Coleattack diagram aboveremain more probable. And he specifically cites the terrorist attacks last March at the Bardo museum in Tunis when cruise passengers from a Costa and MSC cruise ship were killed. He also citesa shorelaunched rocket attack on an Egyptian naval ship in August of last year.
Mr. Goldstein the President and Chief Operating Officer of the cruise line explained that his company makes a lot of effort into its security. Royal Caribbeans cruise ships call on approximately ports annually. Like other companies it makes judgments based on the security information it has received prior to calling on a port. Occasionally it will decide that it is not in the best interests of the cruise line and its guests to go to a particular port like the recent case of Bali which its Celebrity Solstice and Royal Caribbean Radiance of the Seas avoided.
Most places Royal Caribbean sails to are absolutely safe Mr. Goldstein claims.
He said that after the terrorist attacks last year in Paris there was a brief decline in business of a week or two from Northern Europe countries. He said the effect on his cruise line business was de minimis. He does not expect anything different after this latest attack in Brussels.
The FOX News panel also questioned Mr. Goldstein on the effect of the Zika virus on bookings. He also downplayed the effect of this serious medical problem which is believed to cause abnormally underdeveloped heads microcephalyin newborn children.
This is an interesting perspective. Yesterday another financial show on CNBC Jim Cramers MAD MONEY suggested that although cruise lines deny that the Zika virus has affected their operations to date itwill severely impact cruising in the coming months.
Hello this is Royal Caribbean International. We would like to provide you with some important information regarding your March sailing onboard Radiance of the Seas. In an abundance of caution and based on the latest security information we have gathered Royal Caribbean International has made a decision to cancel its call to Bali Indonesia on Thursday March . Additional ports of call have been added to your itinerary. A letter with additional details will be provided to you at boarding. We appreciate your understanding as your safety is always our foremost concern.
Last week sister cruise line Celebrity distributed lettersto the passengers and crew members on the Celebrity Solstice indicating that the cruise ship will not be calling on Bali Benoa due to the potential of a terrorist attack. You can read our article Celebrity Solstice Cancels Stop in Bali Due to Concern of Terrorism.
Today I received copies of letters handed out to the passengers and crew members on the Celebrity Solstice indicating that the cruise ship will not be calling on Bali Benoa due to the potential of a terrorist attack.
the most recent information received in the past few days indicates that the possibility of an incident has increased. Also the Balinese New Year on March th and recent past advisories has named this date as one that would be targeted by terrorists. Based on all of this information we have gathered from various sources and in discussion with our Global Security team in Miami we have made a decision to cancel our call to Bali.
The letter mentions not to nitpick that Celebrity felt that it could not guarantee passenger safety in Bali due to these concerns. Of course cruise lines have no legal duty to guarantee safety but only to act reasonably and to warn passengers of dangers which the cruise companies know or should know about ashore in ports of call.
It looks like Celebrity is acting prudently in taking steps to reduce the threat of harm to its passengers and crew. I have been critical in the past of cruise lines when they cruise passenger into dangerous ports of call like when Costa and MSC sailed into La Goulette Tunisia and ISIS slaughtered several dozen cruise passengers.
The letter sent to the Celebrity crew members today by the Solstices Executive Team mentions what is referred to as credible security concerns that led to the decision to bypass Bali. 
Many crew members are from Indonesia and will now be unable to visit with their family and loved ones.
The Bali bombings photo above occurred in October of in the tourist district of Kuta on Bali. The attack killed over people including Australians Indonesians and people from more than other nationalities. An additional people were also injured.
Jemaah Islamiyah members a violent Islamist group supported by alQaeda were convicted of engaging in the bombings which involved the detonation of a backpack bomb by a suicide bomber and a large car bomb. Three of the terrorists were executed. A recording from Osama Bin Laden stated that the Bali bombings were in retaliation for support of the United States war on terror and Australias role in the liberation of East Timor.
The Jakarta Post recently published an article stating that cruise tourism is increasing in Bali the countrys most famous tourist destination. In cruise ships arrived on the island. 
Trave Agent Central points out that Celebritys sister cruise line Royal Caribbean which shares the same Global Security team is sailing the Radiance of the Seas to Bali later this month as well as in April.
Military.com reports that retired U.S. Admiral James Stavridis stated at a naval private industry conference that the next attack by Islamic State militants may be directed to a navy ship or a cruise ship.
He mentioned the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship by Palestinian militants who murdered JewishAmerican passenger Leon Klinghoffer.
The article mentioned that Commander Stavridis said that ships were most vulnerable when they were first getting underway and going out to sea not when they were pierside or out on the open ocean.If I were an Islamic State planner thats what I would be looking at he said.
This is one of the scenarios which I have mentioned in articles like al Qaeda Planned to Seize Cruise Ships Execute Passengers which I published four years ago andHow the Next Jihadist Terror Attack Against Cruise Passengers Will Happenwhich I published last year.
Some cruise lines have temporarily dropped ports in North Africa Tunisand in the eastern Mediterranean Turkey due to concerns with terrorist attacks. 
News accounts are reporting that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP arrested a cruise passenger in Miamion charges that he has outstanding arrest warrants for kidnapping as well as assault and battery.
The charges involve criminal allegations made in South Carolina. The newspapersaid the unidentified person is now awaiting extradition to South Carolina.
The above quote is rather bizarre because the man arrested is apparently an U.S. citizen who went on a cruise out of Miami which included a port in Jamaica. So the CBP should have arrested the cruise passenger on the assault and kidnapping charges at the beginning of the cruise rather than at the end.
The news release by the CBP is misleading and says that the man was arrested after he arrived here on a cruise ship from Jamaica. Of course there are no cruises which originate in Jamaica. 
The CBP boasts that the arrest demonstrates vigilance and dedication exercised every day by CBP officers to secure our homeland and safeguard our citizens. But the truth of the matter is that the CBP didnt bother to screen the cruise manifest and arrest the wanted man before he sailed from U.S. waters.
We have seen this problem many times. Read our article two years ago Are You Cruising with a Wanted Felon Five Passengers Arrested on Carnival Magic in Galveston.
This reveals a major flaw in the CBP which does not bother to review who is leaving the country on cruises. This person had an outstanding arrest warrant for serious violent felonies yet he was permitted on the unidentified cruise ship to mingle with passengers when potentially he posed a danger to others. 
The CBPs primary mission is antiterrorism it admits so it is inexcusable that it does not scrutinize passenger lists before cruise ships sail out of U.S waters. 
The Customs and Border Patrol should begin vetting the name of passengers before the cruise starts rather than screening passengers only at the end of the cruise. Unfortunately this is standard practice for the CBP which routinely permits rapists criminals with outstanding warrants and other misfits to board cruise ships. Then there is great fanfare at the end of the cruise when the CBP finally take a look at the ship manifest.
As we reported before cruise passengers Steven Mark Anthony Requena photo right age was arrested while disembarking the Carnival Inspiration at the Port of Tampa two year ago. His name was flagged by a sweep of the manifest of passengers by Homeland Security officials who determined that the passenger was wanted for sexual assault in addition to assault with a weapon and forcible confinement. The U.S. Marshals arrested Requena only after the cruise ship returned to port. Regretfully our federal government routinely looks at the ship passenger list only after the bad guys have already boarded the cruise ship.
It is one of the reasons why cruising is more dangerous that it should be. At a time when the world is focused on dealing with ISIS it is irresponsible for our Federal employees not to look at the passenger list before the cruise ship leaves a U.S. port.
Multiple news outlets in the U.K. are reporting that the U.K. naval commander for NATO is warning that ISIS presents a threat to shipping in the Mediterranean Sea.
The popular Daily Mail published UK Commander Warns Mediterranean Cruise Ships Could be Terror Targets.
Its a topic we cover often. It is our belief that cruise ships are woefully unprepared to address the threat of an ISIS attack on a cruise ship and when cruise passenger are sent ashore on excursions where they are particularly vulnerable. 
There are few travel writers willing to have a frank and realistic assessment of the vulnerability of cruise ships to terrorists.
Today the Telegraph published an articleAre Cruise Holidays Safe from Terrorismwritten by U.K. cruise travel specialist Jane Archer who in our assessment down played the threat or terror.
Ms. Archer also says that there is no evidence at all that terrorists have targeted cruise passengers in the past.
She also claims that cruise lines conduct stringent security checks on everyone embarking their ships. Luggage is put through Xray scanners just as it is at an airport before flying and passengers have to walk through detectors before being allowed on board.
Ms. Archers article is essentially a regurgitation of the talking points released by the cruise industrys trade organization Cruise Line International Association.
cruise tourists from a Costa and a MSC cruise ship were slaughtered when they disembarked excursion buses at the Bardo museum in Tunis with absolutely no security and no warnings even though it was widely known to these cruise lines that ISIS presented a danger in the region. The cruise lines cruised their guests into danger and should have sailed them elsewhere but didnt. Cruise lines are often motivated primarily by financial considerations not the safety and security of their passengers. 
Yes of course terrorists have targeted cruise passengers in the past. Putting aside the Achille Lauro terrorist attack back in the s the Rand corporation has more recently stated that cruise passengers are targets. CNN reported that al Qaeda contemplated seizing a cruise ship forcing the passengers to dress in orange Guantanamo Baylike suits and videotape their executions to inflict maximum terror on the public. Read al Qaeda Planned to Seize Cruise Ships Execute Passengers.Of course ISIS just targeted the cruise passengers excursion buses in Tunis.
Think that all passenger luggage is carefully screened for security purposes Ask yourself that question after readingPort of Miami Security Guards Arrested for Stealing Cruise Passenger iPads. Large quantities of drugs are also often smuggled aboard cruise ships by crew members without detection. If crew members or passengers can smuggle large quantities of drugs onto ships in luggage or taping the drugs to their bodies they can do the same with explosives.
U.S. immigrations officials typically do not review passenger manifests until after the cruise ship sails and arrest people with outstanding warrants only when the cruise ship returns to port. Are you about to cruise with a terrorist in the cabin next door Maybe. The Customs and Border Protection officials may arrest the bad guys but only if you make it back to port.
ISIS already blew up an Egyptian frigate at sea just last year photo above. As we all know Islamic extremists blew up the USS Cole many years ago by ramming a small boat packed with explosives into the naval ship killing many U.S. service men and women.
The warning signs are all there. Its your decision who to believe or disbelieve. Do you tend to trust the top NATOnaval commander for the U.K. or a cruise writer for the Telegraph
Yahoo Travel just interviewed me for its articleIs Your Cruise Ship Prepared for a Terrorist Attack
There are nearly comments to the article some of which are quite interesting to read.
The Yahoo article does not really touch upon the issue that cruise ships are largely unarmed. So regardless how you feel about the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution the cruise ships by and large dont have armed security guards. Contrary to people who want to believe that the ships are armed but the cruise lines dont want to tip their hand to the terrorists there is in fact no hidden cache of weapons ready to be deployed by the cruise ships security forces. 
Cruise ships are flagged in foreign countries like the Bahamas or Panama. The international Maritime Organization IMO has no authority to regulate the use of guns on these foreign flagged ship. The IMO does not even recommend that cruise ships have guns.
Are Cruise Lines Taking Adequate Steps to Protect Passengers from Pirate AttacksCruise Line Liability for Injuries to Passengers and Crew Members Caused by Pirate Attacks
Some cruise ships go as far as to install razor wire around the rails and position logs to be dropped on the pirates below if they run their skiffs up to the cruise ship. You can see a photo of this spectacle here.
As we explained in this article the IMO issued guidance on the use of armed guards on ships but stresses that it is still not recommending them. Instead it states that shipping companies should consider arming crew members or hiring private armed guards on board only after conducting a risk assessment subject to approval by the flag state. The IMO also recommends that shipping companies follow all laws and regulations imposed by that flag state regarding the use of armed guard apply to their vessels.
The only cruise ships which seems to permit weapons aboardare flagged in Italy which seems to have a different attitude towards guns and permits cruise ships flagged there like Costa to have weapons aboard.
A Costa ship got itself into a bit of scandal a couple of years ago when a female crew member was photographed holding a huge automatic weapon in the bridge of the cruise ship.The Italian newspaper Oggi published photographs of the attractive Romanian blonde Sasha Alexandra posing in the bridge of the Costa Atlantica. She was photographed next to the captain in a tight cocktail dress holding a large machine gun.
But cruise ships from Carnival Royal Caribbean or NCL flying the flags of the Bahamas or Panama have no weapons at sea.
Cruise lines cant even keep the Ranch Dressing filled at the salad bar . . You are fooling yourself if you think they would be able to fight off an armed boarding takeover attempt.
A Greek newspaper is reporting that the MSC Fantasia has been subjected to a search for explosives today after calling on Haifa.
The MSC cruise ship arrived today in the Bay of Souda near Chania in Crete. A Greek newspaper in Athens To Vima reports that suspicious passengers or explosives may be on board the ship.
The MSC ship carries passengers with a crew of people. The ship was originally headed for the port of Heraklion. The Coast Guard and other authorities at the Souda naval base were reportedly notified.
The newspaper says that the MSC Captain advised the authorities that the ship was changing course because of the weather and that a passenger apparently a German citizen had died and needed to be autopsied to determine whether the passenger died from cardiac causes as suspected. However the newspaper reports that the ship had already changed course for security reasons.
The article said that the recent terrorist attack inIstanbul by ISIS had raised an alert regarding terrorism including attacks on cruise ships sailing in the region.
A German newspaper contains a quote from MSC Cruises saying thatbad weather was the reason for the diversion. The cruise line said rumors of security issues are totally unfounded.
I would be interested in hearing what crew members and passenger have to say about the weather conditions at the time.
There nonetheless appears to be a heightened security alert following the terrorist attack in Turkey.
ABC News reported yesterday thatCrystal Cruises announced that it was canceling stops for the Crystal Symphony in Istanbul and Kusadasi Turkeyin response to ongoing security concerns.
The itineraries for Crystal voyages that set sail April and May will reportedly include destinations in Greece instead of Turkey.
U.S. cruise operators are being tight lipped about whether they are reasonably equipped to respond to security challenged presented by ISIS. However German tour operators recently admitted thatterrorism is their top challenge in . And German tourists may be rethinking their travel plans astourists have become terror targets.
The U.S. State Department has alerted its citizens of possible risks of travel due to increased terrorist threats. Current information suggests that ISIL aka Daesh alQaida Boko Haram and other terrorist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks in multiple regions. These attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics using conventional and nonconventional weapons and targeting both official and private interests.
The warning which technically ended on Tuesday advisesU.S. citizens to exercise vigilance when in public places or using transportation.
ISIS has claimed responsibility for a number of highprofile incidents including the October st bombing of a Russian airliner in Egypt killing people. on a flight fromSharm ElSheikh to St Petersburg and the recent November th attacks in Paris.
President Obama spoke this afternoon on the terror alert and stated that there is no specific and credible threat to the U.S. Even assuming that to be true there have no doubt been prior terrorist incidents which have affected cruise passengers. Cruise passengers from Costa and MSC cruise ships were massacred in Tunis last earlier this year. We have predicted how the next terrorist attack against a cruise ship will take place.
But what can a cruise passenger do Not much it seems. There is no right for a refund if theres a terrorist incident in a country where a cruise passenger is traveling to. Passengers from Viking River Cruises for example traveled around Paris in Viking buses after the recent attacks waiting for their cruises because they had no right to cancel their upcoming cruises. it goes without saying that the mere threat of an attack is a not legal basis to cancel a cruise with any reasonable expectation of obtaining a refund. ReadFive Myths About Travel Insurance and Terrorism.
Cruise Industry Believe Red Tape and Visa Restrictions are a Bigger Threat than Terrorism written by cruise fan and Mirror blogger Captain Greybeard suggests that the cruise line CEOs were downplaying the threat of terrorism this week at theSeatrade Europe conference held in Hamburg.
The Islamist Menace Shadowing This Sept. th written by former mayor of New York RudyGiuliani indicates that America is in denial of the increasing and diversifying jihadist threats of violence. Unlike President Obama who avoids any characterization of terrorism linked to Islamic radicalism Giuliani traces the threat of killing Americans in terror attacks squarely back to extremist interpretation of Muhammads call to jihad. He cites the murder of Jewish cruise passengerLeon Klinghoffer who was killed by Islamic terrorist terrorists while in his wheelchair and dumped into the Mediterranean Sea as an example of what can happen today. 
But families booking cruises to Mediterraneanports of call dont read history books. I doubt that percent of U.S. cruisers know the story of Leon Klinghoffer or could name the cruise ship he was slaughtered on.
This week I was contacted by cruise passengers who were upset that their cruises to Istanbul were canceled. They scoffed when the captain mentioned the threat of terrorism as an explanation.
ISIS radicals today present a threat far more widespread and deadly than the PLO terrorists of the s. Are cruise passengers in denial Yes of course.No one wants to contemplate terrorism at sea during a holiday cruise any more than they wish to consider experiencing a cruise ship fire which is a relatively common occurrence as recent events illustrate.
Are cruise executives downplaying the threat of ISIS blowing up a ship or holding passengers hostage Such talk is bad for business. Other than occasionally canceling a port of two the cruise industry routinely sails through the Suez canal and to ports in Morocco Algeria and Egypt.
Dont assume that the cruise lines will avoid a dangerous port of call. Islamic terrorists killed cruise passengers in Tunisia earlier this year when Costa and MSC cruised blindly into the Goulette port in Tunis. Despite the foreseeable risk of danger presented by Islamic terrorists active in the country and in nearby Libya the cruise lines provided absolutely no security or warnings to their guests.

Celebrity Cruises canceled a stop in Istanbul earlier this week because of concerns with terrorism. We were the first to report on the cancellationinvolving the Equinox.
Today Celebrity canceled more port stopsannouncing that the Reflection will not stay in Istanbul on August st and will depart earlier in the day. Celebrity will also skip theReflections port call in Istanbul on September th th and will instead call on Athens.
On August th Costa canceled all port stops in Istanbul for the remainder of the year.
Costa and other cruise lines are under pressure not to sail more passengers into danger like Costa recklessly did when it cruised to Tunisia in March resulting in passengers being slaughtered. I called for the security chiefs to be sacked.
There are hundreds of cruises scheduled for Istanbul this year. Expect more cancelations

Today I received a message from a passenger aboard the Celebrity Equinox that the Equinox was skipping the port of Istanbul because of the threat of terrorism.
Gabriele Giambrone commented that Celebrity Equinox canceled our planned stop in Istanbul tomorrow due to terrorist fears and high security alerts. We will be having a day at sea instead.
The Wall Street Journal recently mentioned a spate of attacks across Turkey that targeted security forces and a U.S. consulate killed six people.
A recent surge in violence on Turkish soil has largely been blamed on the domestic conflict with Kurdish separatist group PKK not Islamic State . . . Turkey is now battling a chaotic mix of the PKK Marxist militants and Islamic State while dealing with a huge influx of Syrian refugees.
Royal Caribbean and Celebrity have a Global Security Team headed by former FBI senior official Gary Bald. Foreign port safety assessment is a function of every cruise line. Its good to see cruise lines taking affirmative steps to keep passengers and crew members safe rather than Costa and MSC sailing their guests blindly into a danger spot like Tunis earlier this year.

The images posted on Twitteryesterday of ISIS blowing up an Egyptian Navy frigate are frightening.
ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The SITE Intel Group says that the terrorists destroyed the naval ship with a guided missile. The images were widely broadcast. Time and Al Jazeeraand many other newspapers and news stations published them.
Is it foreseeable that ISIS will attack a cruise ship Of course but you would never know that if you rely on the cruise industry or your local travel agent for information and advice.
The cruise industry has a nonchalant view of terrorism. It reassures its customers that its allegedly safe to cruise in the Mediterranean. Costa and MSC and five other cruise lines scheduled calls in Tunis La Gouletteeven after the Bardo Museum massacre where cruise passengers were slaughtered. The second attack in Tunisia was predictable and came in June when a single radicalized Muslim with a Kalashnikov gunned down more tourists at the resorts in Sousse. 
Cruise ships sailing in Mediterranean waters are sitting ducks. I have been criticized before for explaining how the terrorists will attack cruise passengers as they sail off the Coasts of Tunisia Libya and Egypt. 
Terrorists have demonstrated that they can blown up a U.S. Navy vessel USS Cole years ago. When the jihdists want to focus the crosshairs of their weapons on a slow moving cruise ship they can easily do so. The only question is whether the action will be in the form of an external attack suicidal jihadists on a small boat with explosives ram the ship or the terrorists fire RPGs into the hull or whether the terrorists will try and board the ship and take the cruise passengers hostage and begin beheading them on video. 
MSC and Costa sailed their guests into danger in March when terrorists slaughtered cruise tourists as they exited into the Tunis museum excursion site from cruise buses transporting them from the port. The cruise lines neither provided nor arranged security for their customers or for that matter announced even a single warning of the risks of danger.
The cruise lines ignored the considerable risks posed by the ISIS and Al Queda terrorists growing in neighboring Libya and already festering in Tunisia. After the bloodshed the cruise industry quickly launched a PR campaign stating that cruising to Tunis was safe.
SoonMSC and Costa began rescheduling calls to Tunis notwithstanding the loss of life.
Princess Croisieres De France CDF Holland America Line Viking Ocean Cruises and Star Clippers also scheduled cruise ship to head to Tunis as reported by the Cruise Arabia website.
But then terrorists targeted a resort in Tunisia frequented by tourists. On June th tourists were killed. Terrible gruesome deaths. These were not cruise vacationers but mostly British and European families on holiday so the story was not portrayed as an attack on the cruise industry. 
Today theprime minister of Tunisia says that additional plots aimed at massive deaths are in the works. He earlier declared a state of emergency.
tourists to Tunisia were killed in the two deadly attack in Tunisia in the past three months. I suppose it doesnt really matter what the PR departments of the cruise lines say anymore. Their lack of credibility has been established. I believe MinisterHabib Essid when he says that the terrorists are plotting the deaths of tourists whether they arrive by cruise ship airplane or bus.
I reached out today on Twitter and Facebook to determine which cruise lines canceled their stops in Tunis. A couple of passengers tell me that Costa which canceled cruise after the March attacks but scheduled stops in August just canceled some of their calls later this summer. But no word from any travel agents or cruise lines for that matter whether they are still selling cruises to North Africa.
Thirty of the people killed in Sousse were British tourists. Britains Foreign Office warned tourists Thursday to leave Tunisia as soon as possible saying a further terrorist attack was highly likely.
National Geographicals ombudsman Christopher Elliott just published the article which I wrote for Yahoo Travel tiltedIs Cruising Safe A Chilling Look at an Industry Under Siege.
Elliotts article is titledTerrorists Target Cruise Ships Heres What You Need to Know Now.
The poll confirms what I suspected about the cruise industry that is is perceived by the public as pushing itineraries in the Middle East which are potentially dangerous with little concerned about the safety of the passengers.
Costa and MSC Cruises did not issue a single warning to their passengers before unloading them in Tunis. Both cruise lines were pushing excursions in Tunisia. Neither cruise line arranged for security for the buses targeted by the terrorists. The cruise excursion buses unloaded the passengers into a trap because of the negligence of the cruise lines.
Will the cruise industry wake up and protect their guests It seems that the public thinks that the cruise lines can do a lot more.

Tunisia acknowledges it. The risk of jihadists attacking tourists was readily foreseeable. Security analysts and security forces blew it.
In response to this failure Tunisia fired the countrys leading security experts as well as highrankingpolice officers.
Al Jazeera publishedSix Tunisia Police Chiefs Dismissed Over Museum Attack. The article explains thatTunisias prime minister Habas Essid fired six police commanders including those in charge of tourist security and intelligence teams. In addition apolice officer working at the museum was arrested for abandoning his post during the attack.Four other armed police officers were having coffees and a snack when terrorists struck the museum.
The Daily News publishedTunisia Fires Top Security Officials in Bardo Museum Attack Backlash.The article pointed out that the ousted officials include the director of Tunisias tourist police and the police chief for the neighborhood around the Bardo Museum.The decision was reportedly made after the prime minister visited the neighborhood of the attack and observed security problems. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi reportedly also criticized security failures around last weeks attack.
But what about the security chief at Costa and MSC including ship security officers and fleetwide security directors Why werent they fired They are just as responsible for the security failure. The cruise lines picked the port and sailed their guests into danger without any security protection or warnings. The cruise industry is not only refusing to take any responsibility for the massacre but the spokesperson for the Cruise Line International Association CLIAis boasting that cruise ships are a safe and secure place for our guests in the rare event of a shore side incident.
MSC Cruises USA CEO Rick Sasso told Travel Pulse There was no hint of terrorism or uncertainty in Tunisia before the attack . . . There are a zillion ports around the world and we follow all of them. . . There was nothing going on there that indicated this shouldve been a concern.
I am amazed how clueless this cruise executive sounds. Tunisian soldiers were engaged in ongoing battles against Al Qaeda there were prior suicides bombers which targeted hotels and museum attacks which targeted tourists. The UK issued a prior warning of a terrorist attack on tourist sites and the US repeatedly urged caution. ISIS was recruiting young men from mosques in Tunis to be trained and radicalized in Libya. And MSC sails in like everything is fine. 
Its a shame that the PR department at CLIA and the CEO of MSC areengaged in their usual irresponsible shenanigans and gobbledygook.

For the past couple of years Ive been troubled by the increasing violence in North Africa and the Middle East and the unprecedented nature of the cruelty of jihadist terrorists who have beheaded and burned infidels alive.I have worried about various scenarios where cruise passengers are at risk of attack.
We already know that al Qaeda has planned to seize cruise ships and execute passengers.
Our readers have sent us various scenarios of how cruise passengers are at risk on the high seas and in ports of call.
Think its far fetched Think again. Al Qaeda has already used this weapon to attack tankers in the Middle East. In the video below you can see the terrorists fire their weapons yell Allah Akbar God is Great and run off into the bushes. Cruise ships are easy targets over three football fields long and stories high moving at only a few knots an hours while entering and leaving ports. A RPG would slice though the aluminum hull like butter and cause fire damage injuries and death. Theyre sitting ducks without military escorts.
. . . This isnt about the ports and the safety of them. A terrorist could be among you at the buffet laying by the pool playing slots drinking at the bar they lay in wait. Theyre completely legitimate looking like one of us. of them could board a ship as a passenger with a clean record. Theyve been trained in other countries. Theyve lived in the countries theyre in for years and they lay in wait anticipating their marching orders. Then three days into the cruise they take over the ship and start killing passengers . . . And thats how itll go down.
The cruise industry needs to wake up. Tunis was preventable. Greater attention to Al Qaeda and ISIS is necessaryto avoid a similar if not worse attack on innocent passengers. Dangerous ports need to be avoided. In the past Princess Cruises used security teams police to accompany tour bus excursions in Egypt. Maritime security teams are also required in foreign ports of call to address the risk of waterborne attacks. Cruise lines are overflowing with cash. The cruise industry collects around billion a year pay their crew members peanuts and doesnt pay U.S. taxes. The industry needs to start investing some of those tens of millions of dollars into substantial security to keep their guests safe.

The cruise industrys favorite publication Travel Weekly just published an article titled After Tunis attack Impact on Cruise Sales Pondered.
The article speculates whether cruise sales will drop following the Islamic States massacre of cruise passengers in Tunis last week.
In the last couple of years first quarter wave sales were negatively impacted by the Costa Concordia disaster in January and the Carnival Triumph poop cruise in February . The article suggests that whereas the sinking and engine room fire could arguably be blamed on the cruise lines the public is not likely to fault the cruise lines for the terror attack last week.
I disagree with that premise. Costa and MSC sailed into a country with a history of fighting between Tunisian solders and Al Qaeda resulting in dozen of soldiers killed and wounded over the last two years. Tunisian men have been recruited to train in ISIS camps inLibya. There had been prior attacks against a popular museum in Tunisia and a suicide bomber blew himself up in a hotel frequented by tourists.What did the cruise lines think would happen after Tunisians were radicalized and trained to use automatic weapons in Libya and then returned home
The public can easily conclude that the cruise lines sailed their guests into harms way without warnings or any thought of providing security for the excursion buses.
But the cruise supporters are out in full force spinning the story to exculpate the cruise lines.
Bud Darr a mouthpiece for the Cruise Line International association CLIA argues that the terror attack against cruise passengers was not targeted at cruise passengers.
The editor of Cruise Week Mike Driscoll spun the attackoncruisepassengers as not a black eye for cruising because its not the cruise lines fault and it didnt happen on a ship.
Travel Weekly interviewed a travel agent who said I think were all keeping our fingers crossed that this will not have a negative impact.
Travel Weekly published statements from the Cruise Line International Association CLIA who claims that cruise lines have worked for many years with security and law enforcement authorities around the world to ensure passenger safety. CLIA claims that it hasprocedures to provide an immediate and effective response to any securityincident.
The day before the attack the cruise executives were salivating over expanding their markets into North Africa and making greater profits. Their minds were on money not security. 
A former cruise line security chief was highly critical of the absence of any security for the Costa and MSC cruise passengers. 
CLIA and Travel publications like Travel Weekly will continue issuingstatements and publishing stories claiming that cruise passengers are safe and sound in North Africa and the Middle East. But thespecter of dead passengers certainly will scare customers away and drive down cruise sales especially in the Mediterranean. If the cruise industry is going to cross its fingers it better be in the hope that ISIS doesnt target a cruise ship.

As the death toll increases in Tunis the former Director of Princess Cruises says that cruise security was lax and the cruise lines failed to assess the danger associated with sailing passengers into Tunis.
Commander Mark Gaouette told IHS Maritime that cruise security measures for passengers should have been stronger.
I believe the risk management process failed to properly assess the extremely volatile situation in North Africa he said.
. . . at a minimum more security should have been required for that excursion in the form of armed police or military escort and armed presence at the museum itself.
The death and injury tally ranges around dead and to passengers injured.
I remain amazed that the Costa captain piloted the Costa Fascinosa out of the port in Tunis and left passengers behind not knowing whether they were dead or injured. I cant help but think of Costa Captain Schettino leaving passengers behind as he fled the sinking Concordia in Giglio. Do I have this wrong To give the Fascinosacaptain the benefit of the doubt I can only assume that he may have been concerned that terrorists might attack the ship itself and slam RPGs into its hull or gun their way up the gangway and look for hostages. In that sense maybe it was prudent to escape the port as soon as possible although it begs the question why Costa was there in the first place. 
Why any cruise line would sail into Tunis is beyond me. In and many dozens ofTunisian soldiers were killed and even more injured in deadly attacks perpetrated by alQaeda and other Islamic fighters according to an article titled Terror and Politics in Tunisia in the publication World Affairs. Tunisia is a major recruiting ground for ISIS. Recruits are trained in Iraq Syria or Libya and then return to Tunisia radicalized. 
Costa and MSC have stated that they will not call on Tunisia in the foreseeable future. To me thats like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted as the saying goes. Whether these cruise ships will actually stay away remains to be seen. We have seen cruise lines announce with great fanfare that they are leaving a Caribbean port after a cruise passenger or employee has been killed ashore. They always return after the media attention dies down.

Newspapers are reporting that severalgunmen stormed a popular museum in Tunis Tunisia today killing tourists as well as a police officer and Tunisian civilians. Some news accounts report that as many as two dozen people were also injured.
Two cruise ships were in port and had sent thousands of passengers into the city on excursions. CNN says that some of the cruise passengers were at the museum at the time of the attack. The Daily Mail reports that aTunisian tourist guide told how he stared death in the face as terrorists opened fire on his clients in the attack which saw people shot as they exited cruise ship buses parked outside the museum.
CBS News says that the terrorists targeted tourist buses when they arrived at the museum. The terrorists dressed in police uniforms then opened fire on the tourists before they could reach the museum. 
On the occasion of today scheduled call some guests on cruise on board our Costa Fascinosa had a tour in the city. All the shore excursions organized by Costa during today stop in Tunis have been immediately recalled on board the company said in a statement. 
The Italian newspaper stated that the Bardo museum is visited regularly by tourists with many disembarking from Mediterranean cruises.
Commentators believe that the group is affiliated with an Islamic terrorist organization like ISIS. Tunisia is a major recruiting ground for ISIS.

One question I am asked frequently is whether Islamic terrorists pose a threat to cruise ships. I received a couple of such inquiries in the last week. One from a mother in the U.K. whose son works on a cruise ship sailing the Mediterranean and another from the father of a family in the U.S. thinking about taking a cruise from Spain to France Italy Greece and Turkey and back. 
Yesterday several newspapers in Europe and the Middle East Mail OnlineAl Arabiya News interviewed experts who have painted the scenario of speed boats operated by Islamic State terrorists attacking fishing boats cruise ships and small merchant ships to capture people and parade them in orange jumpsuits before a video with a knife to their neck. 
We have all seen the stories on CNN about the gruesome killing and beheading of innocent aid workers and journalists by ISIS in an effort to terrorize the televised world. In the last two weeks we have also read stories about the barbaric burningaliveinacage of the Jordanian pilot and the beheading of twentyone Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya. We are of course all afraid to actually see the videos of the terrifying violence.
As we sit in front of the television in our homes here in the U.S. we all feel safe from the terrorists dont we The beheadings are after all over there in foreign places like Iraq Syria Yemen Libya and other unstable Arab countries.
But when U.S. citizens decide to fly to Europe and go on a cruise vacation with their family in the Mediterranean are they placing themselves in harms way
The thought of Muslim terrorists hijacking a cruise ship is hardly new.Achille Laura instantly comes to mind. Forcing terrified cruise ship hostages into orange suits and executing them al Queda has already planned thatjust a couple of years ago. CNN would cover the terror nonstop.
There are numerous studies by security companies and U.S. governmental organizations which have studied terrorist organizations and concluded that terrorism against cruise ships is likely.
The World Cruise Industry Review publication concluded several years ago that a likely terrorist scenario is the hijacking of a cruise ship and its passengers while terrorists kill passengers if demands are not met.
The issue has been discussed by a number of experts including Commander Mark Gaouette who is the former director of security for Princess. He wrote a book Cruising for Trouble which specifically addresses the potential of a cruise ship as a target for terrorists.
years ago U.S. service men and women were brutally murdered when Islamic suicide bombers rammed their speed boat loaded with explosives into the U.S. navy ship the U.S. Cole.
If the U.S. Navy cant protect its military fleet what chances do thousands of U.S. tourists think they have of staying safe on a gigantic U.S. based cruise ship floating like a sitting duck in the harbor ofSharm elSheikh Egypt
ISIS has already taken over port cities in Libya which is strategically located in the middle of North Africa. It would be easy for ISIS to launch a suicide jihadbysea against cruise ships sailing to or from North Africa and the Middle East.
Jihadists are already using cruise ships to sneak into war zones says the Maritime Executive.The fear is that the radicals will shift their focus to making the ship itself the war zone.
Families thinking of cruising in the Pacific Northwest Seattle Vancouver Alaska may be reasonably safe from an ISIS attack. A terrorist attack seems extremely unlikely to happen in the Caribbean. But sailing into a port in Morocco Tunisia or Egypt on a cruise ship Its not a matter of if. Its just a matter of when.
The Associated Press AP reports that jihadi fighters are increasingly buying tickets on cruise ships to join extremists in battle zones in Syria and Iraq.
The AP states that jihadists are tryingto bypass travel restrictions in neighboring Turkey.
According to the APTurkey says that it has been deporting hundreds of terrorists caught in airports and bus stations. But there are some fighters or more from countries traveling to the Middle East to fight for extreme Islamic causes.
The BBC reports that Islamic militants areusing of cruise ships more and more.
Originally our concern about people on cruise ships dangerous people on cruise ships really focused on the classic sort of rapist burglar or violent criminal. But as weve gathered data weve realized that there are more and more reports that people are using cruise ships in order to get to launch pads if you will sort of closer to the conflict zones of Syria and Iraq.
Terrorism is a concern for any kind of international travel. The current news does not suggest an attack by such groups on cruise ships but there is historical evidence of such attacks.We have written about plans uncovered two years ago by al Qaeda to seize cruise ships and dress passengers in orange jump suits and execute them. Three decades ago Arab terrorists killed cruise passengerLeon Klinghoffer on the Achille Lauro cruise ship and a decade ago our U.S. Navy lost several dozen sailors who were blown up during the attack on the U.S.S. Cole by an al Qaeda group.
Several readers of Cruise Law News sent us articles today reporting that Greek police officers boarded the Costa Magica while it was in the Port in Piraeus Greece and arrested four passengers who had possession of firearms. 
The Croatian newspaperSlobodna Dalmacija Daily reports that the incident occurred on Thursday October nd.
Approximately other passengers embarked from Venice on a sevenday Mediterranean cruise. Once the ship reached Greece the Greek police boarded the Magica and arrested one woman and three men for possession of firearms pistols.
The cruise ship was delayed departing from Piraeus because of the incident. The incident was not announced on the ship and the passengers seemed to be unaware of it.
The newspaper says that the news about the arrest of four passengers could not be found either in the Greek or in the Italian media. The newspaper interviewed crew members from Dubrovnik who explained the circumstances surrounding the arrests.
The newspaper say that the information was suppressed because it was bad for the cruise industrys business.
Those interviewed explained that there are passengers and suitcases simultaneously screened in just a few hours and it is impossible to effectively screen so many passengers and luggage in such little time.
This is particularly worrying the newspaper suggested when the Islamic states repeatedly threaten harm to the Americans and their allies.
The article is entitled The Terrorists Tried to Hijack the Cruise Ship with Passengers.
There is no indication why the passengers had the guns nor is there any proof or explanation in the newspaper that they were in fact terrorists.
Anyone with more information about this incident please leave a comment below or join the discussion on our Facebook page.
A number of news sources are reporting that the Tunisian government prohibitedIsraeli passengers from disembarking from a cruise ship at a stop at the Port of Tunis.
Norwegian Cruise Line NCL a U.S.based cruise line told the Israeli citizensthat they were not welcome by the Tunisian government and had to stay aboard the cruise ship.
Bnai Brith Canada released a statement yesterday stating that there were approximately Israelis on board the NCLship. They did not know in advance that they could not leave the ship during the port of call.
According to the Jewish Telegraphic AgencyJTA the cruise line had a responsibility to its passengers and to advise them of this discriminatory policy in advance Bnai Brith Canada CEO Frank Dimant said in a statement. Better still the cruise line should avoid ports that have such policies.
During Norwegian Jades port call in La Goulette Tunisia on Sunday March a small number of guests holding Israeli passports were not allowed to go ashore because of a last minute decision made by the Tunisian Government. Port taxes for the call in Tunisia are being refunded to these guests.
We apologize for any inconvenience to our guests and appreciate their understanding. We are reviewing this decision with the appropriate officials.
NCLs statement is pathetic. NCL should not be downplaying the incident like this. The Tunisian governments action should be immediately and unequivocally denounced in the strongest language possible. 
This is not about returning nominal port taxes to inconvenienced guests. It is about much deeper and important issues. No citizens of any nation should be subjected to such discrimination. The fact that an Arab nation would exhibit such contempt and hostility against Israel is particularly despicable.
What lessons were learned from the hijacking of the Achilles Lauro cruise ship and the murder of passenger Leon Klinghoffer Have we forgotten his death and the terror inflicted by an Arab terrorist group against cruise ship passengers in the Mediterranean and ending in the murder of a Jewish passenger 
Tunisias actions sent a clear message to Israeli citizens. NCLs response should be equally clear. The only reasonable action is for NCL and the cruise industry to boycott Tunis as a port.
We want to send a strong message to Tunisia and ports around the world that we will not tolerate such random acts of discrimination against our guests. We are outraged by this act and the fact that we were not notified in advance of this practice. We apologize sincerely to our guests who were affected and want them to know that we have taken the appropriate action in response.
NCL announced the boycott during the Cruise Shipping Miami CSM today. I walked by the Tunisia delegation photo left. They must be feeling rather foolish.
Newspapers in Cyprus and Israel are reporting that security forces in Cyprus thwarted a planned terror attack against Israeli tourists.
Cypriot security forces seized a powerful explosive in the port of Limassol local paper Alithia reported. The explosive was described as capable of causing massive damage.
The newspapers state that the perpetrators intended to target Israeli tourists visiting on cruise ships to Cyprus which is a popular tourist destination for Israelis.
Earlier this summer Cyprus arrested a Lebanese man with links to Hezbollah who was planning attacks on Israelis in the country. Israel has said the attacks were part of a concerted effort by Iran which employs the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah as its proxy to target Israelis around the world.
Years After Hijacking of Achille Lauro Can Cruise Ships Keep Passengers Safe in the MiddleEast
In April I blogged about a plot where Arab terrorists envisioned hijacking a U.S. based cruise ship forcing the passengers to wear orange Guantanamolike jump suits and then videotaping their execution.
There are numerous studies by security companies and U.S. governmental organizations which have studied terrorist organizations and concluded that terrorism against cruise ships is likely.
The issue has been written about by a number of experts including Commander Mark Gaouette who is the former director of security for Princess cruise line. He wrote a book specifically addressing the issue of cruise ships as a target for terrorists.
Twentyseven years ago today the world saw terrifying television images of Palestinian terrorists holding passengers aboard the Achille Lauro cruise ship hostage. The terrorists demanded the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
There were over nationalities of passengers booked on the cruise but the terrorists stated that Americans would be the first to be executed if their demands were not met. 
Leon Klinghoffer age was from New York City and was vacationing with his wife Marilyn and their friends when the Achille Laurosailed for Port Said Egypt. Although Mr. Klinghoffer was disabled and in a wheelchair the terrorists picked him to be the first to die. They shot him in the chest and head and then forced two crew members to dump him and his wheelchair over the side of the cruise ship.
That terrible crime occurred in October . Now years later are cruise passengers particularly Americans any safer
We have seen civil unrest across North Africa. President Mubarek is gone from Egypt and Colonel Gaddafi of Libya is dead. Good riddance to both I saybut both countries now seem more dangerous to Americans than ever. Last month we saw antiAmerican demonstrations on the anniversary in both of these countries and the murder of the U.S. Ambassador to Libya in Benghazi.
On the front page above the crease of the New York Times this morning are several articles about violence in Syria with a photo of a Syrian firing a Kalashnikov rifle. I not sure who is fighting who anymore but they all seem to have the potential to take their violence to U.S. interests.
In April I blogged about a plot where Arab terrorists envisioned hijacking a U.S. based cruise ship forcing the passengers to wear orange Guantanamolike jump suits and then videotaping their execution.
years after Leon Klinghoffers dead body was dumped into the Mediterranean Sea the danger of terrorism against cruise ship passengers seems greater than ever before. Have cruise ships increased the number of security guards aboard their cruise ships I doubt it. Every cabin occupied by a security guard means less revenue for the cruise lines. 
The current strategy seems to be to simply skip ports in Egypt Morocco and Tunisia until things calm down. But thats a short turn fix when the street protests are over there remains the risk of jihadists plotting a cruise ship to target. Will the cruise security teams be ready
If terrorists can overpower several heavily armed U.S. Marines and kill our Ambassador in Libya does anyone really think that they are safe sailing on a Holland America Line or Princess cruise ship sailing into Tunis or Port Said
The disturbing trend of violence against the U.S. in places like Libya and Egypt is causing the cruise lines to scramble to swap out ports of call in North Africa for ports in Italy and Malta.
HALs Ryndam skipped a port Tunisia yesterday and instead visited Sardinia Italy.Royal Caribbeans Mariner of the Seas will avoid Alexandria Egypt next week and will call on Sicily and Valletta Malta on the next two days.Cunards Queen Elizabeth skipped a call today in Alexandria and will visit Rhodes tomorrow.
In April I blogged about a plot where Arab terrorists envisioned hijacking a U.S. based cruise ship forcing the passengers to wear orange Guantanamolike jump suits and then videotaping their execution.
There are numerous studies by security companies and U.S. governmental organizations which have studied terrorist organizations and concluded that terrorism against cruise ships is likely. Take a look at this report by the RANDorganization.
When I was a kid my family lived in Tripoli Libya starting in until the s. The Libyan people back then mostly Sunni Muslims were peaceful. But today Libya Egypt Tunisia or Morocco are the last places on earth I would sail my family to. 
Cruise ships are simply not equipped to handle a terrorist attack. Cruise ship security cant even handle drunk passengers. And I would not trust the port authorities in these Arab countries to provide adequate protection against Islamic fanatics strapped with explosives who would love to blow up a cruise ship with Americans aboard.
There is a disturbing story today in CNN entitled Documents Reveal al Qaedas Plans to Seize Cruise Ships . . . The CNN article explains that an alQaeda operative was caught with encoded digital data which once deciphered revealed some of the terror groups most audacious plots and a road map for future operations. 
The terrorist group had far reaching plans to conduct operations in Europe and to kill cruise ship passengers as part of its reign of terror.
Musharbash takes that to mean that the terrorists would then start executing passengers on those ships and demand the release of particular prisoners.
The plan would include dressing passengers in orange jump suits as if they were al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and then videotaping their execution.
Are cruise ships prepared to deal with a well organized attack by a jihadist terrorist organization 
Do you believe that the cruise industry has done enough to protect passengers from terrorism or are cruise vacationers sitting ducks Please leave a comment below.
CBS Channel reported today that acheck of a suspicious package at thePort of Miami resulted in the evacuation of a cruise ship terminal. The evacuation was orderedaftera police dog alerted to the package.
Miami police ordered the evacuation of Terminal C which was in use Friday by NCLsNorwegian Sky cruise ship. CBS reported that the evacuation covered only cruise and port employees working in the terminal becausecruise passengers arriving Friday had yet to be allowed inside to board Fridays cruise.
The MiamiDade bomb squadand HazMat crews were was called to check the package. A port official eventually said the package turned washarmless.
The AP is reporting thata twentythree year man whohad apparently been placed ona nofly listtraveled from Oregon to New Yorkby train and then boarded a cruise ship in order to sailto England.
The article identifiesMichael Migliore as a Muslim convertwhohad tried unsuccessfully for months to fly to Italy where he planned to live with his mother.
According to the AP Miglioresaysheis on the nofly listbecause he refused to cooperate with FBI agents who wanted to question him after an acquaintance was charged in a plot to bomb a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland.
After being barred from flying Mr.Migliore decided to travel across the U.S. by train and then sail on a cruise ship to Europe. Once he arrived in England the British police arrested him.
Now this strikes me as rather strange. I dont know Mr. Migliore.I have no idea whether he is a potential terrorist threat or a nice guywho was arbitrarily labeled a threat because he converted to Islam. I tend to sympathize with U.S. citizenshavingtheir liberties taken away withoutnotice or due process.
But ifthe U.S. really placed him on a nofly list because of a good faith belief that he is prone to blow up a airplane whydidnt it place him on a nocruise list Thisstarted me thinking is there such a thing as a nocruise list If not why not If you are inclinedto take down an aircraft it seems like a cruiseship is an equally attractive target.
Does the Transportation Safety Administration TSA Homeland Securitythe FBIand Customs and Borderpeopleshare information of potential dangers in the air and on the sea If sowhy is someone who is such a danger to be placedon a nofly list permitted to board a cruiseship for a transatlantic cruise
This weekendour television has alternated between college football games and documentaries about the horror of .
Iwas in my office talking to Dad who was with my Mom visiting my sister in Park City Utah. I waswith him on thetelephone when the first tower began to fall.I remember himyellingholy shit son the tower is falling We then both hung upto watch the spectacle.
There have been some insightful articles about how disruptedourlives and changed our perspective of the world around us. The Connecticut Post published an interesting article A September Cruise Leads Passenger Home to a Changed City which is the account of a real estate agent in Connecticut who goes with her husband on a cruisefrom Southamptonwhen the plane struck the twin towers.
The towers were a landmark that seemed to always be in the background of every cruise ship photographed in New York harbor. I found such a photo and thought it might beappropriate to add it to this article. But while uploading it I realized that it shows the H.M.SBritaniswhichsank off of the coast of South Africa in October .

The Tribune newspaper in the Bahamas is reporting that a pleasure cruise on board the Discovery cruise ship turned into terror and aggravation for hundreds of passengers when a bomb threat stopped the shipat night en route to Port Everglades in Ft. Lauderdale. The incident began whenMiami Dade Police Department received a call around PMthat a man was aboard the shipwitha gun and a bomb.
The Discovery cruise ship ship leftGrand Bahama with approximately passengers around PM. The fivehour cruise back toPort Everglades usually arrives around . PM.
The newspaper indicates that passengers were restricted to their cabins and in certain areas of the ship while the search was conducted. The newspaper also quotes a passenger stating that everyone was very scared and some persons were even upset because of the long delay and late arrival into Fort Lauderdale.
If you were a passenger aboard the Discovery please leave a comment about the experience below.
One of theproposals recommended bythe International Cruise Victims ICV organization ishaving sea marshals on cruise ships in order to protect passengers and respond to shipboard crimes.
Since the Federal government has placedair marshals on airplanes. The ICV has attempted to ensure that cruise ships have the same level of security by supporting legislation in California requiringsea marshals on all cruise ships entering and departingcruiseports in that state.
Unfortunately the cruise industry fought againstan independent police force on cruise ships.The typical argument is that state law enforcement have no jurisdiction over foreign flag cruise ships on international waters. However there is no question that states like California have jurisdiction to place sea marshals on cruise ships once the ships reach state waters to act as a police presence andto monitor environmental activities. Alaska has a very effective sea marshal program designed to monitor cruise ship waste waterdumping.
The port of Los Angeles already has a sea marshal program. By all accounts it is successful and serves the valuable purpose of protecting passengers. As explained in an article today Marshals Defend Port of L.A. in the Contra Costa Timesthe port of Los Angeles hassixsea marshals as well asan additional eight to port police officers who are trained to join the team.The L.A. sea marshal program is seperate from the sea marshal program operated by the U.S. Coast Guard which board vessels up to milesoffshore.
The sea marshal program in L.A. isgeared toward addressing vulnerabilities ascruise ships and cargo vesselhead into and out oftheharbor.Sea marshals boardcruise ships miles from port. They arearmed. They make sure that no one forces their way into the bridge tohijackthe ship and uses itasa floating bomb or abattering ram just as alQaida terrorists forced their way into the cockpits of jetliners on .
Sea marshals also inspect various areas of the cruise ship look for explosives drugs suspicious activities and coordinateunderwater inspections byport police divers once thecruise shipsreach port. Theyremain onthe bridge where they keepwatch asthe cruise ships sail out of the Port of Los Angeles. They return to port once the vessels reach miles offshore.
It remains less than clear whether the sea marshalsin Los Angeleshave responsibility to handle reports of crime which occur at sea as the cruise ships sail back to California. Undoubtedly the local sea marshals can liason with the Los Angeles Port Police andthe FBI.
Los Angeles has proven that a sea marshal programon a state level can work. More ports and states need to followLos Angeless lead.
This month is the th year anniversary of the death ofcruise ship passenger Leon Klinghoffer an American Jewwho was killed byPalestinianterrorists who hijacked the cruise ship he was sailing on with his wife in the Mediterranean Sea in .
Mr. Klinghoffer age wasfrom New YorkCity and was vacationingwith his wifeMarilyn and their friends when fourheavily armedterrorists hijacked the Achille Lauro cruise shipafter it left Port SaidEgypt. Although Mr. Klinghoffer was disabled and in a wheelchair the terroristsshot him in the chest and head and then forced two crew members to dumphim and the wheelchair he was confined to over the side of the cruise ship.
The terrorists demanded the captain sail the cruise ship to Syria andIsrael release Palestinian prisoners.After a twoday drama the hijackers surrendered in exchange for a pledge of safe passage out of Egypt to Tunisia.But when an Egyptian jet tried to fly the hijackers away from justiceU.S. Navy F fighters intercepted the jet and forced it to landin Sicily. The terrorists were taken into custody by Italian authorities. The four terrorists were convicted and sentenced to jail but a mediator Abu Abbas from thePalestinian Liberation Army PLO who planned the hijacking waspermitted to leave Italy to the outrage of Americans. The U.S. Army subsequently captured Abbasduring the invasion of Iraq.
The tragicincident isknownfor the brutalnature of the Palestinian terrorists against Mr. Klinghoffer the involvement of the PLOand the bold action of President Reagan in foiling the terroristsescape.
But thetheincidentis also well known in legal circles fordemonstrating the extraordinary steps which cruise linestake to limit their liability.
Mrs.Klinghofferand the estate of Leon Klinghoffer daughters LisaandIlsa were the administrators filedsuit in the Southern District of New York against the owner operator chartererof the Achille Laurotravel agenciesvarious other defendants and eventually the PLO. Other passengers who were aboard the Achille Lauro during the hijacking also filed suit.
The familiessued the cruise linedefendantsfor failing to have adequate security to protect the passengers from the terrorist attack.
The cruise ship was operated by the Lauro Line and marketed by the Chandris Line whose risk management department was based in New York City. The claims supervisorsubsequently went to workfor Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises.
Rather than trying to reach a settlement with the grieving family the cruise line defendants threw upevery obstacle imaginable to prevent the Klinghoffer family from obtaining compensation. The cruise linedenied responsibility and claimed that the attack was unforseeable. They filed motionsto dismiss claiming that they did not engage inbusiness in the U.S. They argued that the forum selection clause which we have discussed inother articles in the passenger ticket limited their liability to only and in any eventanylawsuithad to bebrought in Naples Italy.The cruise line defendant thenfiled claims against the PLO arguing thatif anyone should be responsible for Mr. Klinghoffers death it was the PLO for planningthe hijacking of the cruise ship.
The lawsuits lasted over years at great emotional and financial expense of the Klinghoffer family.
Finally the cases were resolved shortly before trial when the PLO made a confidential financial settlement which resulted in the creation of a nonprofit organization the Leonand Marilyn Klinghoffer Memorial Foundation.
As a result of the ordealour U.S. Congress enacted legislation which provides a basis to sue terrorist organizations when they are involved in the deaths of U.S. citizens.Cruise lines however remain free to use forumselection clauses and contractual limitations of liability to make it difficultfor Americans to obtain compensation.
The lastingmaritime law implications ofMr. Klinghoffers death is thatno cruise line can realisticallyclaim that the hijacking of a cruise ship by a terrorist organization isunforeseeable given the vivid memories of that terrible day twenty five years ago on the Achille Lauro.
Daughters Keep Up Terror Fight for Leon Klinghoffer years after Attack on Achille LauroNY Daily News
I responded immediately that it was in violation of international law and morally indefensible.
For those cruise fans who are not current on international news two days agoIsraelicommandos boardedacruise shipin international waters.The ship is the MV Mavi Marmarapassenger ship formerly owned and operated by a Turkish ferry company and now owned by a Turkish Islamist charity the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedom and Humanitarian Relief. TheMavi Marmara with around Palestinian supporters was sailingwith food toys andrelief supplies for Palestiniansin Gaza.Israel boarded the ship to enforce an embargo of Gaza.
Passengers on the cruise ship called activists in many press accounts attackedthe commandos after they rappelled from a helicopter. Watch the video below. Whenthe violence ended Israeli forces had killed passengers and injured others. The passengers injured Israeli soldiers critically.
My opinion remains that this was a clear violation of international maritime law. TheU.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea entitlesvessels free passage on the high seas. It was also amorally indefensible attack on citizens in international waters. I received a lot of flak for my opinions. There are few peoplein the U.S. based cruise industry orcourthouses in Miami who have much sympathy for the Palestinian cause particularly after . The U.S. is preoccupied withfighting the war on terror and in theprocessevery Arab relief agency is labeled as a tool for AlQaeda Hamas or Hezbollah.
But putting politics aside this is a straight forward issue. International law prohibits the boarding of vessels in international waters. Attacking a relief ship in this manner is as illegal as engaging inpiracyoff of the coast of Somalia.
Some argue that Israel has the right to enforce the embargo and make certain that humanitarian shipments into Gaza do not include weapons.This may sound good butit presupposes that the embargo is legal.The siege of Gaza is wrong and severely punishes Palestinians by depriving them of food medical supplies and basic services. TheU.N.told Israel to end the embargoin the first place.
International law also requires that onlyproportionalforce may be used in the face of violent resistance. Yes the commandos were met with violence when they illegally boarded the vessel on the high seas.You can see this clearly in the video. But shooting protesters in the head with automatic weapons is not proportional or morally defensible particularly when the commandos had no right to board the ship in the first place.
The local news media is reporting that Royal Caribbean recently received a bomb threataboard theLiberty of the Seas cruise ship.
There have been a number of bomb threat hoaxes recently. Perhaps themost publicized one was when a passenger from VirginianamedIbrahim Khalil Zarou who was reportedly quite intoxicated Bomb Hoax Gets Drunken Carnival Cruise Passenger Arrested
Fortunately these bomb threats turned out to be hoaxes. But what if they were real
In this most recent bomb threat the FBI and other federal agencies did not board the cruise ship until eleven hours later.
Are cruise lines equipped to handle a real terrorist threat on the high seas Most cruise lines have as few as or security guards on duty at night and some lines do not monitor their surveillance camerasexcept in the casinos. Is this adequate security for to passengers and crew
Our experiencesuggeststhat the few security personnel on cruise shipshave a difficult enough time deterring or responding to bar fights between drunken passengers. A realterrorist threat on the high seas will pose a real problemto the cruise industry.
CBP Will Study Costs of Requiring Cruise Ships to Hand Over Their Passenger Reservation Data
A Baltimore man is back home after surviving a deadly terrorist attack at a west African hotel on Friday and he says there were a couple of things that saved his life.
Ed Bunker was in the middle of a terrorist attack Friday night at the Splendid Hotel inBurkina Faso. Hesaid he had just finished an early dinner and went to his room to pack for the trip home the next day.
He heard a fire alarm checked the lobby on two separate occasions saw nothing and returned to his room only to find out minutes later that he was in the middle of a terror attack.
Im fortunate to be alive Bunker said. It was a jarring experience. I am still processing it and trying to come to terms with what happened.
He was there working with Jhpiego an organization affiliated with Johns Hopkins that helps strengthen health systems in foreign countries. Once he figured out that there was an attack Bunker searched for a hiding place and found one near a shed in the pool area. A staffer saw him and told him to go to his room and stay there.
I later learned he really gave me some good advice that probably saved my life because the location of the terrorist attacks was on the opposite side of the hotel Bunker said. I felt the best thing to do was hide myself instead of trying to get out of the hotel and going into the mayhem in front of the hotel.
Bunker hunkered down in his room watching television reports while fires and explosions erupted outside. He was on the phone with the U.S. embassy and on email to stay informed. Eventually he learned that French special forces were in the hotel to rescue people.
They knocked on my door very loudly. I announced my presence as I had been advised and slowly opened the door and raised my hands Bunker said.
Bunker was given a U.S. military bodyguard by the U.S. embassy. He and others were escorted to an area in the hotels restaurant. At one point they were told to get on the floor because the hotel was coming under fire.
He physically covered me and covered me with his rifle and his position Bunker said. I was highly appreciative of him literally laying down himself to protect me. We need to keep that in mind as Americans. We have people serving overseas who are doing this on a daily basis.
Bunker returned home Sunday afternoon. He said that while he was one of the lucky ones the people who lost their lives in the attack must not be forgotten.
I am a bit of a statistician. Ive run the numbers in my mind. There were hotel rooms people lost their lives and if you start to do that math I see how fortunate I was Bunker said.
Bunker said this experience will not stop him from travelling because its an important part of his job.

The dead include Stphane Charbonnier who used the pen name Charb and was the very brave editor of Charlie Hebdo the cartoonists Jean Cabut who signed his work Cabu Bernard Verlhac Tignous Georges Wolinski and Philippe Honor Mustapha Ourrad a copy editor the columnists Bernard Maris and Elsa Cayat Frdric Boisseau described as a building maintenance worker. Ahmed Merabet and Franck Brinsolaro were police officers. Michel Renaud was visiting the office when he was shot dead. Vox has a list. They were assassinated. The gunmenwere not on a suicide mission they fled and stole a carwhich the latest reports suggest has been located in the Twentieth Arrondissement. The Guardian and others have live updates these include video clips of a shootout. The gunmen were still at large in Paris as of the early afternoon there andpresumably armed. Children were evacuated from schools near the Charlie Hebdo office which was in the same building as at least one other media organization. Some workers in the building managed to hide from the shooters but it wasreportedly a production day at the magazine busy and crowded. This was an attack on a publication and a neighborhood a country and its press and on any journalist in any city. The magazine made fun of peopleof many faiths for many follies which we all need to be reminded that we have. Some of the cartoons were blatantly roughly sexual and not designed to endear them to Jews or Christians. Satire was Charlie Hebdos mission and a necessary one. There were times whentheFrenchgovernmentasked the magazine to hold back but the magazine kept being itself which is what one wishes for in a free press.Wednesdays crime should not cause anyone to secondguess Charlie Hebdos editorial decisions. Silence is not where the answers to an incident like this lie.
Recently the magazine had mocked the Islamic State in Iraq and alSham or ISIS.The lasttweeton the magazines account before news of the attack was of a cartoon of the groups leader Abu Bakr alBaghdadi. As the BBC noted there are questions about its exact timing and provenance. But making fun of alBaghdadi is not recklessness its how one knows thatISIShas not won and never will. There ought to be more tweets that do so.Whether ISIS inparticularhad a role in this attack is a question that cant be answered at this stage its members are sadly not the only ones in the terrorism business.The current issue of Charlie Hebdo published the day of the shooting featured a caricature of the novelistMichel Houellebecq on the cover. Houellebecqs new novel Submission also outWednesday according to the Timespredicts a future France run by Muslims in which women forsake Western dress and polygamy is introduced. The drawing of Houellebecq accompanied by a joke about Ramadan is not flattering. The French police have added the protection of Houellebecq to their list of priorities on what is by all accounts a traumatic and disorienting day for the entire country. He deserves safety and not chastisement. Barack Obama David Cameron and Angela Merkel have all quicklycondemnedthe attack and the wider assault on the press. The rector of Pariss Grand Mosque added his voice saying according to the Times We are horrified. Our community is stunned by what just happened. Its a whole section of our democracy that is seriously affected.

In a deadly terror strike that reminded the world of the attack on Mumbai on November suspected Islamic State gunmen launched a coordinated assault on Paris late on Friday night leaving dead and injured. The worst terror attack in Frances history eclipsed the shooting inside the Charlie Hebdo newspaper office in January which killed and injured . 
French President Francois Hollande announced that he held the IS responsible for the attack and France considered it an act of war. He announced a state of emergency the first in France since and the deployment of soldiers. 
The attack was carried out on six locations one being the French national stadium Stade de France where France and Germany football teams were playing a friendly before an strong crowd. Mr. Hollande who was among the spectators was evacuated immediately following security protocol. At least people were killed in the attack at the Bataclan Theatre during a concert by the band Eagles of Death Metal. The gunmen entered the seat venue and began shooting without warning. The police said the assailants were killed. A Syrian passport was found on one of the attackers. 
The band members are safe but have not been located. A spokesperson for the band said We are still currently trying to determine the safety and the whereabouts of all our band and crew. Our thoughts are with all of the people involved in this tragic situation. A relative of one of the band members confirmed that all of them were safe. 
The soldout concert hall in the trendy th arrondisement in eastern Paris bore the brunt of the attack which began around an hour after the performance began. The terrorists armed with AKs and suicide bomb vests took the fans hostage and began shooting them clinically before the police raided the place. As soon as the raid began three of the four terrorists blew themselves up. The police killed the fourth. 
In the same arrondisement more people were killed as gunmen fired inside a caf. A few hundred metres from the Bataclan five people were killed on the terrace of a pizzeria. The th arrondisement with its restaurants cafes and bars is a popular district among revellers. The nights mayhem began around p.m. when a gunman fired at a bar and a restaurant in the th arrondisement in northern Paris killing people. Six kilometres north explosions went off outside the Stade de France. Four people were killed in this attack. France won the match . At the Gatwick airport in Britain a yearold Frenchman was arrested with a weapon that appeared to be a firearm. 
As Paris came under attack on Friday night French fortitude under adversity shone through. 
While being evacuated from the stadium where France and Germany played a friendly football match the spectators sang the French national anthem turning it into an intensely emotional affair and a symbol of French fortitude in the face of terror. The video has since gone viral. 
President Francois Hollande said France had vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. France would be merciless with the nations enemies. We will work alongside our allies to fight this terrorist menace he said in his address to the nation. France is strong and even if she is wounded she will get up always and nothing will hold her down even if we are feeling the grief now. 
The stadium witnessed two suicide attacks one at each entrance and a bombing close to a McDonalds restaurant outside. People were seen on the streets with bloodied faces and limbs trying to escape. 
The other four attacks took place at La Belle Equipe cafe on Rue de Charonne dead Le Carillon bar and cafe and the adjacent Le Petit Cambodge a Cambodian restaurant dead and La Casa Nostra restaurant five dead. 
What has shaken the French in general and Parisians in particular is that this is the second big terror attack in one year. Paris is hosting the United Nations Conference on Climate Change from November to December in which more than heads of state are expected to participate. France is the host of Europes top football competition next year the UEFA European Championship. 
The city of Brussels is on lockdown after a suicide attack at the citys Zaventem Bruxelles International Airport and a blast on a train this morning leftat least dead and up to injured.
This morning two bombs were detonated in Zaventem airport and a third exploded at Maelbeek metro station in the city the station local to the headquarters of the European Commission.
What we feared has happened said Belgian prime minister Charles Michel in a press conference the Guardianreports. Here are many dead many injured We realize we face a tragic moment. We have to be calm and show solidarity.
Reports have confirmed that shots were fired in the departure hall at Zaventem airport before two suicide bombs were detonated one in the departures hall and another on a runway. Questions are already being raised about how anyone managed to get a device past airport security.
Following the blasts at the airport there was an explosion at Maelbeek metro station whichtook place at around a.m. the height of the rush hour.
There is speculation that the bombings are retaliation to the arrest of the Paris attacker Salah Abdeslam who was captured four days ago in a gunfight in the Belgian capital on Friday.

As the world continues to mourn thedeadly terrorist attacks in Paris on Nov. more and more TV is making adjustments to its regularlyscheduled programming out of a sign of respect.
TNTs Legends is the latest series toshift its schedule with the network announcing Monday theyd postponed tonights episode. As a result of the recent tragic events in Paris tonights originally scheduled episode of Legends has been postponed they said. Our thoughts and condolences are with the victims and their families.
The pulled episode entitled The Legend of Curtis Ballard follows Sean Beans Martin as he searches for Kate Aisling Francoisi in Paris certain that the protest shes attending will turn violent. The network has not yet announced whether the episode will be aired at a later date.
Elsewhere U along with LiveNation and HBO canceled two concerts in Paris meant to be performed over the weekend with the cable network scrapping its plans to air Saturday nights performance live. An announcement made on the bands website said the concerts would go ahead at an appropriate time.And on the evening of the tragic events NBC made the decision to forego Undateables live episode instead airing a repeat. The following evenings episode of Saturday Night Live went ahead as planned albeit with a somber and quite touching message to Paris in place of its usual cold open.
Sadly this is hardly the first time realworld tragedies have been the reasoning behind programming shifts on television. In two episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayers third season that depicted violence in school were delayed for months as the first was scheduled to air just one week after the Columbine High School massacre. Following the September terrorist attacks many TV shows adjusted existing episodes with The Simpsons removing The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson from syndication for many years as portions of the episode are set in the World Trade Center and Friends cutting scenes with Chandler Matthew Perry joking about bombs in an airport from The One Where Rachel Tells.
The Boston Marathon bombing and Sandy Hook school shooting led NBC to shelve a episode of Hannibal where guest star Molly Shannon brainwashed children making them kill other kids. The episode never aired on TV but was eventually placed on the networks website. And just this past August USAs breakout series Mr. Robot delayed its season one finale by a week following the horrifying shooting deaths of reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward in Virginia which eerily mirrored a plot point in the episode.
It hasnt always been acts of terrorism that have forced the networks into action either. A Family GuyAmerican DadThe Cleveland Show threepart crossover set to air in May was pushed to October of the same year after a deadly tornado outbreak terrorized the Southern Midwestern and Northeastern parts of the United States in late April of that year. History repeated in when the season finale of Mike Molly which featured a plot about a tornado was originally scheduled to air the same day a deadly tornado occurred in Oklahoma.

The city of Brussels is on lockdown after a suicide attack at the citys Zaventem Bruxelles International Airport and a blast on a train this morning leftat least dead and up to injured.
This morning two bombs were detonated in Zaventem airport and a third exploded at Maelbeek metro station in the city the station local to the headquarters of the European Commission.
What we feared has happened said Belgian prime minister Charles Michel in a press conference the Guardianreports. Here are many dead many injured We realize we face a tragic moment. We have to be calm and show solidarity.
Reports have confirmed that shots were fired in the departure hall at Zaventem airport before two suicide bombs were detonated one in the departures hall and another on a runway. Questions are already being raised about how anyone managed to get a device past airport security.
Following the blasts at the airport there was an explosion at Maelbeek metro station whichtook place at around a.m. the height of the rush hour.
There is speculation that the bombings are retaliation to the arrest of the Paris attacker Salah Abdeslam who was captured four days ago in a gunfight in the Belgian capital on Friday.

There have also been reports that Paris will light up the Eiffel Tower in the colors of the Belgian flag tonight in solidarity with the Belgian people.
The attacks take place one month ahead of art events in the cosmopolitan city with Art Brussels due to open on April and Independent Brusselsdue to open its doors on April .
Messages of solidarity have been pouring in on social media and spontaneous slogansof hope have been drawn on the citys pavements.
A simulated largescale terrorist attack will be staged at Fenway Park this weekend.
On Sunday the Boston Police Department in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security the US Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center and Fenway Park will practice and prepare for an active shooter situation.
The exercise which will run from a.m. until p.m. Sunday will include inaudible simulated explosions and multiple rounds of realisticsounding simulated gunshots. During the drill various security technologies will be tested including working dogs metal detection and unmanned aerial systems.
Fan safety is a topic we continually discuss and evaluate and by participating in this exercise led by Boston Police alongside state and federal agencies we hope to gain valuable insight that may help enhance how we keep visitors safe at Fenway Park said Red Sox Director of Security and Emergency Services Charlie Cellucci.
Officials said there are no threats or any security concerns and the event is just a drill.
Boston police will put out a casting call for more than volunteers to act as fans.

Erratic human behaviour and incomplete information plague efforts to model risk.
Police in Verviers Belgium investigate after antiterrorism operations on January that left two suspects dead.
From France to Nigeria the world is reeling from a wave of deadly terrorist attacks. As governments scramble to respond researchers and analysts are attempting to calculate what the terrorism risk is and how it is changing. Such insights are crucial for those trying to foil attacks and for companies that offer insurance against terrorism but it is neither an easy nor an exact science.
To calculate the risk of attacks analysts must have access to a system for tracking events that have already happened. That is not straightforward in part because terrorism is hard to define the boundary between crude acts of terrorism and violent insurgencies is blurry.
Overall it shows that the number of reported events from targeted assassinations to hijackings and suicide bombings has sharply increased globally since the turn of the millennium mostly driven by attacks in the Middle East Africa and south Asia. In the past ten years half of all global terrorist attacks and of all fatalities occurred in just three countries Iraq Afghanistan and Pakistan. By contrast after the attacks in the United States on September Europe and North America suffered relatively few successful attacks.
Counterterrorism measures vary between regions. In areas widely controlled by militant organizations such as the Afghan Taliban ISIS or Boko Haram responsible for an attack in Baga Nigeria this month that killed an estimated people among other events counterterrorism forces are ineffective corrupt or simply absent. However many Western countries stepped up prevention measures in the wake of .
Plots in the West that were not foiled including fatal attacks in Madrid in London in Norway in and most recently against the magazine Charlie Hebdo and in a supermarket in Paris may be due to terrorist organizations switching to using fewer operatives relying instead on small cells and lone actors says Miller. This makes it less likely that details of a planned attack will leak out. AlQaeda propaganda is clearly encouraging individuals to take up small attacks on their own she says.
As well as tracking attacks the GTD is also being used to make predictions. Relying in part on the database Aaron Clauset a computer scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder found in that the likelihood and magnitude of terrorist attacks are related by a phenomenon known as a power law. Smaller strikes with relatively few fatalities such as in Paris are sooner or later followed by a rare event with extremely high severity such as A. Clauset and R.Woodard Ann. Appl. Stat. .
Power laws are a source of mathematical fascination because they describe a wide range of phenomena including earthquakes and stockmarket collapses. But Clauset used the relationship to predict that given the historic rate of smallscale attacks there is at least a chance of another attack on the scale of in the next decade somewhere in the world. He also points out that very large events are more likely under a power law than they would be under a bellshaped distribution something that counterterrorism authorities should consider.
His predictions are relevant on a global scale but they do not help to assess the risk to specific cities or companies or the absolute magnitude of attacks. Besides counterterrorism agencies one group tasked with addressing those issues is insurance underwriters who must assess the terrorism cover that is mandatory for large businesses in the United States and a number of European countries.
The attacks caused insured losses exceeding US billion a nuclear detonation over Chicago Illinois or Los Angeles California would cause hundreds of thousands of fatalities and financial losses far in excess of billion according to Risk Management Solutions in Newark California which develops terrorism risk models for insurers.
However such estimates are uncertain. The modelling resembles a game of poker in that it depends on erratic human behaviour and incomplete information.You cannot reliably track terrorism risk without access to classified information says Erwann MichelKerjan executive director of the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
Because insurance companies have not had to pay out substantial claims since terror premiums have steadily decreased. However the terrorism landscape is in flux and MichelKerjan says that governments scientists and insurance companies are pretty lost when it comes to quantifying such a volatile risk. Charlie Hebdo could have happened anywhere any time he says. We may not need to raise insurance premiums right away but we will all need to pay more attention to what is happening in the Middle East connect the dots and do the science.

Islamic terrorists have claimed responsibility for the horrific attacks that claimed at least lives in France. Now you know that most Muslims are not terrorists. Even if Muslims were hypotheticallybehind every single one of the terror attacks committed worldwide since those terrorists would represent barely . percent of global Islam. Itseasy however to fall into the slightly more believable trap that most acts of terror are committed byIslamic extremists.
By the way thats about percent. One percent of all terrorist attacks in the European Union between and were religiouslymotivated.
Religiously motivated includes Islamic extremists as well as Christians Jews Hindus and Buddhists who were motivated by their religion to hurt others.The rest were a mixture of violent separatists far left extremists like the Sect of Revolutionaries in Greece and farright extremists proUkrainian forces.
Prior to Europol categorized terrorist attacks differently but those numbers arent any less eyeopening. Between and member statesrecorded terrorist attacks in the EU and only eight were Islamist. For those of you keeping score that means Muslim terrorists were responsible for a meager. percent of EU terrorism during those years.
Now to be fair Islamic and religious extremism is still a growing problem in Europe. Among EU member states attempted terroristattacks inspired by religion have spiked from attempts in to attempts in . And the body count for religious extremism tends to be higher than that of separatist attacks. In for instance only . percent of theterrorist attacks in Europe were religiouslymotivated but nearly half of the people murdered in these attacks were killed by religiouslyinspired terrorists.
Religious extremists appear to carry out fewer terrorist attacks on the whole and fail more often that not but when they succeed a lot of people die.

It was a fathers worst nightmare. Geraldo Rivera tearfully recounted how his daughter Simone was watching a soccer match in a Paris stadium as the horrifying terrorist attack on the city unfolded on Friday Nov. .
His voice breaking as he held up a photo of his yearold daughter Rivera who is a Fox News contributor was visibly shaken as he told colleague Shepard Smith My daughter Simone told me she heard the three explosions near halftime It was chaos.
At least three bombs were set off outside the soccer stadium reportedly killing several people. Multiple mass shootings also occurred with gunmen storming the Bataclan arts center where the American band Eagles of Death Metal was among the bands performing. The concert attack killed at least concertgoers according to CNN. I just thank god she was at the stadium and not at the rock concert Rivera said.
The newsman said that he and his family were due to fly to France Thanksgiving week to see Simone who is spending her junior year abroad.
When he finally managed to reach her he advised Simone not to take the subway. We dont want her to travel to do anything.
Thank God daughter Simone is safe. After fleeing soccer stadium she was stranded. A blessed Paris friend drove to area is taking her home.
Simone was emotional as she later spoke to Fox News on the phone and admitted that she was still shaking. As her crying father pleaded with her not to go outside or talk to strangers he said that he wanted to go to Paris and get her and had a plane waiting but the borders were closed. The French president ordered the borders closed in the wake of the attacks.

The following timeline lists terrorist attacks against the United States and Americans living either in the U.S. or abroad.
The horrific tragedy that occurred in Paris this morning was more than an assault on human life.
The shooting deaths of people in an attack at the office of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdowas also an assault on freedom of speech and expressionand understandably that has rattled and angered those who createart of all kinds for a living.
CNN reported Wednesday that three suspects have been identified two of whom are Parisborn brothers.
Asked about the attack on the paper which had been the target of threats in the past for publishing cartoons spoofing militant Islam Tina Feytold reporters at the Television Critics Association press tour today Obviously this is terrible and tragic and upsetting. It makes you remember how important free speech is and must be defended. We all must stand firm on issue of free speech.
We are Americans Fey who will be hosting the Golden Globes this Sunday with Amy Poehler continued. Even if its just dumb jokes in The Interview we have the right to make them.
Terrible terrible. Overwhelmingly sad Meryl Streeptold reporters when asked her thoughts at the London premiere of Into the Woods. But the antidote for that is to live joyously tolerantly and with attention.
The fact that this was an attack on journalists an attack on our free press also underscores that these terrorists fear freedom of speech and freedom of the press President Barack Obama said in a speech from the Oval Office this morning. A universal belief in the freedom of expression is something that cant be silenced because of the senseless violence of the few.
Journalists know that their jobs carry risks but these brazen killings were particularly shocking in that these journalists were not operating in an overseas combat zone but were at work in their own offices in a democratic nation. The right to free speech is not only enshrined in the U.S. Constitution we believe it is a universal human right and we oppose all those who seek to squelch free expression. Today SAGAFTRA stands with the French people and the worldwide journalism community. Our hearts are with you.
The hashtag JeSuisCharlie has been active on Twitter all day today used as a sign of solidarity with the victims the citizens of Paris and any and all who know that attempts to bully and terrorize free nations into submission with threats and violence will not put a dent in our convictions.
Heres a sampling of the reactions emanating from the creators corner of the Twitterverse those who know that the cornerstone of their livelihoods is the right to read write poke fun and otherwise say what they want.
Sometimes a picture says it better than any writer could. CharlieHebdo pic.twitter.comOPhYZUWs
I feel I must add my own small voice against the revolting attack in Paris. jesuischarlie
I deleted a silly tweet because Ive just read about the terrible events in Paris. JeSuisCharlie
Purefoy followed up with a tweet noting that the scene was in Lyon not Paris.
If I believed in an allpowerful God Id also assume he could do his own murders.
Heres to rational thought truth education evidence freedom of expression one day leading to peace on earth.
I am heartbroken by the loss of life and attack on freedom of expression. JeSuisCharlie
What a tremendous loss. A free press is our greatest weapon against tyranny home and abroad. JeSuisCharlie pic.twitter.comQTytTkGTb

PARISGunmen and bombers attacked restaurants a concert hall and a sports stadium at locations acrossParison Friday killing at least people in a deadly rampage that a shaken President Francois Hollande called an unprecedented terrorist attack.
APariscity hall official said four gunmen systematically slaughtered at least young people attending a rock concert at the Bataclan music hall. Antiterrorist commandos eventually launched an assault on the building. The gunmen detonated explosive belts and dozens of shocked survivors were rescued.
At least more people were killed in five other attacks in theParisregion the city hall official said including an apparent double suicide bombing outside the national stadium where Hollande and the German foreign minister were watching a friendly soccer international.
The coordinated assault came as France a founder member of the U.S.led coalition waging air strikes against Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq was on high alert for terrorist attacks ahead of a global climate conference due to open later this month.
ParisPublic Prosecutor Francois Molins said the death toll was at least . Five gunmen had been neutralized.
The terrorists the murderers raked several cafe terraces with machinegun fire before entering the concert hall. There were many victims in terrible atrocious conditions in several places police prefect Michel Cadot told reporters.
After being whisked from the soccer stadium near the blasts Hollande declared a nationwide state of emergency the first since the end of World War IIand announced the closure of Frances borders to stop perpetrators escaping.
TheParismetro railway was closed and schools universities and municipal buildings were ordered to stay shut on Saturday. However some rail and air services are expected to run.
This is a horror the visibly shaken president said in a midnight television address to the nation before chairing an emergency cabinet meeting.

Intelligence in the leadup to Friday evenings terrorist attacks in Paris was not nearly so scarce as had initially been indicated and several nations including Iraq and Israel appear to have been passing France intelligence on the matter in the days leading up to the attack.
According to the Times of Israel French Jewish security officials were informed of an impending large terrorist attack in France on Friday morning There was considerable speculation in the leadup that Frances Jewish community would be among the targets.
Ultimately this appears not to have been the case though the community notes that the Bataclan the site of the massive hostagetaking was until very recently Jewishowned and has repeatedly been the site of both IDF fundraisers and antiIsrael protests raising speculation that this made the target higherprofile for ISIS.
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu also reported in a statement this weekend that Israel has been sharing intelligence with France and other relevant countries about the attackers in Paris saying the intelligence sharing has been ongoing and was not just over the past day.
Every time theres some terrorist attack israel makes these claims why is that 
Has nobody asked the question how within a few hours at the most of the attacks that the French tricolor was displayed in perfectly coordinated light displays across the worlds most famous urban landmarks The Brandenburg Gate The NYC Trade Centre The Western Wall The Sydney Opera House etc There must have been some highly dangerous and feverish changing of light bulbs in the middle of the night no 
Shame they couldnt have mobilized such incredible coordination and near unbelievable lightningapplied skill to prevent the attacks in the first place. 
Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.Theodore Roosevelt 
Americas next president will inherit more than a bitterly divided nation teetering on the brink of financial catastrophe when he or she assumes office. He will also inherit a shadow government one that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are in essence running the country.
This article reminded me of viewing this informative reporting done back in . 
Aug Massive Joint Military Training Exercise in Niagara Region Ontario 
Exercise Stalwart Guardian which began on Saturday August in the Niagara region of Ontario. The military exercise involves several armored regiments and over Canadian American Scottish and British troops operating in public areas.
Perfectly possible. The Israelis may have hoped to create a style overreaction which is not happening. Thats just not the European way. There have been a series of attacks on French nationals since the Charlie Hebdo attack which looked very like an attempt to create a stampede but Europeans are much too lucid to imagine that bombing people in Syria will protect them in France. Israel itself is a perfect example. Theyve spent nearly years trying to crush the Palestinians by force and have nothing to show for it but a solid reputation as childkillers. Theyre caught in a vicious circle of attacks followed by revenge raids which are as militarily useless as they are politically counterproductive followed by further attacks.If Putin is fool enough to go down that road so much the better but I dont see any other European country following his example. 
Hollande is certainly beating his chest right now and following it up with at least raids on the usual suspects plus throwing out the policy of open borders etc. There will be more repression that is the only tactic that nationstates know having been created and maintained by violence. 
French Jewish security officials were informed of an impending large terrorist attack in France on Friday morning 
The source article says this security officials in Frances Jewish community. 
French Jewish security officials could mean Jews who work in Frances security apparatus. Security officials in Frances Jewish community is something else entirely. 
The warning given to the French government on October was published openly and specified that it would be impossible to stop this kind of attack. How is that for terrorising the public into passivity 
Also I read on the net there where antiterrordrills shortly before the attacks
Well theres a lot of conflation of the Jews with particular people and organizations who happen to be largely or completely Jewish. That conflation is unfortunate and often serves haters well. But it comes from all directions. Israel as a state and organizations in most western countries make largely uncontested claims to represent all Jews. 
So as far as this collective letter is concerned it appears to have been issued by some agency of the state of Israel and to have been directed to officials in French Jewish organizations which concern themselves with the security of and not entirely without basis but the basis is inflated claim to represent the Jewish community. 
Its not surprising that those who spend their time looking for secret Jewish conspiracies and other reasons to hate Jews would see what they want to see in this. Disgusting but not surprising. 
I deleted several comments. Both antisemitic and complaints about antisemitism. These people are part of the problem. Collectivist thinking. Enough. 
Extending his sympathy to families of victims Jaberi Ansari underlined the need to cooperate to confront terrorism saying the attack once again showed the high possibility of terrorist actions in Central Asia and indicates the need to cooperate fully to fight extremism and its political and ideological bases.
According to Interior Ministry of Kazakhstan on June a group of followers of radical nontraditional religious movements attacked two gun shops and an army unit of the National Guard in Aktobe a city located kilometers miles from Russias border TASS reported.
Seven people were killed in the attack including three servicemen. people were wounded the Kazakh Health Ministry said.
A total of criminals were killed in an antiterrorist operation and four others were wounded. Another nine people were detained on suspicion of their involvement in the attacks. A moderate yellow terrorist alert has been declared in all regions of the republic for at least days the same source reported.

The worst of the attacks occurred at the Bataclan theater where multiple gunmen stormed the concert venue. The attack came as the American band Eagles of Death Metal were playing inside.
Several armed men came into the concert. Two or three men not wearing masks came in with what looked like Kalashnikovs and fired blindly on the crowd Europe journalist Julien Pierce told the BBC.
It lasted between and minutes. It was extremely violent and there was panic. The attackers had enough time to reload at least three times. They were very young.

Few Americans speak with such frankness about political correctness radical Islam and Donald Trump as comedian Bill Maher. 
Through his standup act and his longrunning HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher the avowed liberal and sacredcowkiller has zero problem making his lefty pals feel uncomfortable as he challenges their preconceived notions of right and wrong.
In particular Mahers criticism of Islam has garnered a great deal of blowback from fellow liberals and mainstream Muslim organizations such as the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations which has labeled Maher absurdly an Islamophobe.
So in advance of his appearance at Phoenixs Comerica Theatre on Sunday at p.m.New Timesgot Maher on the phone to discuss Muslims Donald Trump encryption and why size really does matter when it comes to Islamic terrorism. 
And you know that Ted Cruz by the way had that prepared for months he said boy how Donald Trump got to the right of me on the Muslim issue so next time theres an attack guys we need something to come up with. And his presidential campaign had that ready for months. As soon as there was an attack they brought that out. OK were gonna one up you Trump were gonna call for surveilling Muslim neighborhoods. Hes just despicable. Anyway. No I dont agree with Trump but what I keep saying is if there is another attack especially and maybe even without it and the American people have to choose between that and a party that wont even say the term Islamic terrorism yeah I could see them voting for Trump. Which is a horrible thought for everybody worst of all for Muslims. 
Why do you think Democrats are so afraid of using the term Islamic terrorism I think the problem that Democrats have had in general in the lifespan Ive been following politics is that they dont lead they follow. They sense what their constituents want to hear and then they say it. Now Republicans I dont agree with their policies but Ill give em this they dont follow the polls all the time. They say well this is what the polls show well change it. For example the public option for healthcare was polling very high before Obama became president. Something like percent thought that was a good idea. And by the way it was supported by many Republicans. It is called the public option. Its just an option. Its about freedom. I thought they liked freedom.
So what they said is the polls show that this is high well well change the polls. Well meet in our secret lair and well get all our people together to say the same dumb talking points and well knock that approval rating down from to percent. The Democrats dont do that. . Democrats have this idea which I have been fighting against that Islamic terrorism is somehow if you say that term an act of bigotry. And theyre afraid to challenge it. So I would like to goad them into challenging it. As I keep saying I think Im the liberal in this debate.
Is this something you get into in your standup routine as well Oh yes. I mean I dont do anything in my standup that isnt chock full of laughs because thats what standup should be so we dont get into every aspect of it. But absolutely this is something that I relish talking about in standup and I think in the last few years Ive really turned a lot of people around. I think a lot of times liberals have just not thought about this issue all that much. I think they have this idea in their heads that Muslims are a minority and anytime you criticize a minority somehow you are violating some rule of liberalism. Whereas what Im saying is . if youre a liberal then you have to stand for liberal principles.
Im the son of two liberals. I remember what those liberal principles are. And its always being on side of the people who are the oppressed or the downtrodden or the put upon. And how you can be for blacks women gays poor people immigrants lettucepickers victims of police brutality you name it whatever the cause the bullied the molested the disabled and then look upon a woman who has to wear a burka a complete tarp over her whole body all the time and not see that as oppression is amazing to me because this idea that well its her culture she likes it. She likes it Thats what pimps say. 
What do you think about the controversy in France where a government minister over there has gotten into trouble by comparing Islamic veils to slavery I dont think you can tell people how to dress no matter what they want to wear. Obviously if youre taking a drivers license photo you cant cover your face though that has been tried. But the battle has to take place in a different arena than government . and convince folksthat they want to have the option not to wear an Islamic veil just the way that we have to convince people that theocracy is not the way to go that honor killings are a bad idea and that killing cartoonists killing people that leave the religion and wanting to murder gay people for being gay are all bad ideas.
Am I saying all Muslims believe this Of course not. But this idea that liberals have which is encouraged by Democratic politicians . that somehow its just a very small percentage the terrorists that believe illiberal things and the rest of the Muslims the whole religion has been hijacked. Well thats plainly not true. Theres an extraordinary amount of polling that they have done in the last five years that tell us we dont have to guess about this. 
Trump talks about it like every Muslim is a terrorist which is crazy. And the Democrats talk about it like its just this very small percentage which is silly too. And again we can look at the polling. A country like Indonesia percent of the people according to the polls believe in honor killings. So what youre telling me with that is that in Indonesia a country which many people hold up as a moderate Muslim nation almost out of people think when a woman is raped we blame her and kill her for it. Yeah you see I dont understand why the liberals get upset about that.
Some Muslim writers locally Phoenixs Dr. Zuhdi Jasser have expressed the opinion that the real problem is that the separation of church and state is not an idea with deep roots in the Muslim world. What do you think about that Right. Again. Heres something I said on the first show of our season which upset a lot of people which was it was our first show after the San Bernardino killings and following those murders I heard many people in the media talking about how Americans if they only knew more about Islam they wouldnt be so afraid. And I said actually its the exact opposite they dont know anything about Islam. And if they knew more you think they probably would be more afraid. And this is a good example of what you just brought up. I dont think people realize that in so many Muslim countries the separation of church and state just doesnt exist. I mean sharia law you know whats in sharia law some of those things I was just mentioning we cut off your hands if youre a thief we kill you if you are an adulterer or you have premarital sex or if you marry someone outside the religion. We kill you if you leave the religion. It varies from country to country its not always as bad as it is in Saudi Arabia. But again these are very very illiberal ideas. Liberals have got to stand up for liberalism else youre not a liberal. 
Something else you often hear among liberals in the aftermath of terrorist attacks perpetrated by militant Islamists is that theres no difference between extremists whether its an antiabortion extremist or a neoNazi its all the same. Once again this is pure ignorance. This is just again liberals talking out of their ass. Its them wanting to believe something and going by that as opposed to facts. Which ironically is exactly what they hate Republicans for doing. But look size matters. Of course you can always find an example of bad behavior in any culture. No one certainly not me is arguing that that the only bad behavior in the world is taking place in Muslim countries. What Im saying is size matters. And again we can quantify this. .The New York Times says there are Muslim militant groups in the world. . Okay there are Christian militant groups in the world on this order Of course not. 
So this notion that liberals always go to of you say something bad about Muslims and then I will say something bad about the Ku Klux Klan. Except the Ku Klux Klan is not trying to acquire nuclear weapons. When is the last time the Ku Klux Klan pulled off anything like any of the Islamic terrorist attacks I can name practically off the top of my head I can name four just in Europe in the last year. Its what they call a false equivalency. Thats a really annoying argument that they should know better than to make.
If we accept that Islamic terrorism is an existential threat to the U.S. then how do we address the issue of encryption and encrypted messages and balance that with freedom of speech the right to privacy and so forth Every single lawenforcementperson Ive seen talk about it in the last month or so has said were blind now. We dont know what theyre thinking. We dont know what theyre talking about. So obviously this is a problem that is going to have to be dealt with. 
We all want our privacy thats important. But I would maintain that the old rubric I think it was said originally by Benjamin Franklin or somebody like that somebody from that era who said those who would give up their privacy for their security deserve neither and did not live in the era of nuclear weapons. Im sorry but the stakes are just a lot higher. 
Yes wed all like our dick pics to be private but you know what if they become public its not as bad as a dirty bomb going off miles from where you live. And these guys are not playin. They are actively seeking it. We found out that those guys in Brussels were actively surveilling a nuclear scientist. They were either going to blackmail him or kidnap him someway to get nuclear material. And unfortunately there is a lot of nuclear material in the world. Which President Trump only wants to increase. 
Well that kind of ends on a downer. Laughing I would like to say that when I come to Phoenix my show is all funny and not all about this.

This symbiosis is indeed worth examining in greater detail as it is as vicious and dangerous as it is largely overlooked. In this study how and why terrorists utilize media tools how and why the media covers acts of terrorism and the coverage in the aftermath of the attacks in in the US will be examined. To conclude a way forward to counter the damaging effects of the symbiosis will be provided.
As Hoffman argues to explain the abovementioned symbiosis without the medias coverage the acts impact is arguably wasted remaining narrowly confined to the immediate victims of the attack rather than reaching the wider target audience at whom the terrorists violence is actually aimed. In a similar vein Stohl in Staci Bennett and Flickinger argues that terrorists are primarily interested in audience not the victims and emphasizes that how the audience reacts is as important as the act itself. Accordingly winning the attention of the media national and foreign publics and decisionmakers in a government is one of the primary goals of terrorists. To this end terrorists carefully select the places in which they carry out their attacks in order to provide the best media coverage. As will be addressed later in greater detail the obvious example of this is the attacks in the US where a wide variety of media covered the story immediately. Not only was the media able to capture this incredibly visual attack but the people who were in New York City residents and tourists alike were also able to document this event with pictures videos and personal stories Baran .
Indeed the goals of terrorists are not solely confined to winning the attention of the masses. In addition to that through the media they aim to publicize their political causes inform both friends and foes about the motives for terrorist deeds and explain their rationale for resorting to violence Nacos . They further aim to be treated like regular accepted legitimate world leaders as the media gives them a similar status. That is to say for terrorists the media functions as a tool to shrink the power asymmetry between them and the entity they fight against in an actual and ideological warfare create an atmosphere of fear and suspicion legitimize their acts and reach greater audiences. Given these motives terrorists arguably carry out their attacks rationally and strategically with full awareness of the influence of the media coverage on almost every segment of a society and government officials of almost all levels. To illustrate this Ayman alZawahiri the current leader of alQaeda argues that alQaeda is in a battle and more than half of this battle is taking place in the battlefield of the media. AlQaeda is in a media battle for the hearts and minds of the ummah Seib and Janbek .
Terrorists means of communication greatly vary. Indeed technological advancements and changing audience behavior in the past decade enabled terrorist groups to utilize media tools with greater convenience. Specifically in the years since the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union crumbled the mass media of communication have changed in dramatic ways mostly because of the global reach of the Internet and cellular phones Nacos a. The new and emerging media has made it easier for terrorists to publicize their messages to the world via websites at their own discretion and new technologies have simply allowed the dissemination of terrorist messages to reach a broader audience with a more concise message Baran . In the words of Moutot terrorists do not really need printed media anymore to convey their message. The official media have been replaced by the Internet which in the end is much easier to use much quicker and much more effective Nacos . In other words the Internet has arguably replaced the role of the printed media in the field of terrorism as for the first time in history terrorists can take whatever message and images they decide to straight to the online world which is global in reach Klopfenstein in Kavoori . As their stories and messages reach the general public either through the old media or the new media terrorists use this publicity specifically in their recruitment efforts. In brief the Internet clearly increased the scope of terrorist propaganda and activities and became a perfect tool for terrorists in terms of advancing their operational goals with little expense and risk.
Despite this the power of other media forms and technologies such as video and audiocassettes DVDs video games popular music and novels should not be underestimated Nacos b. Terrorists generally embrace the newest information follow the latest technological developments to be innovative and utilize the most uptodate communication technologies however it does not necessarily indicate an absolute shift from old technologies and trends as for instance some terrorist organizations even today rely on hawala the informal network of money exchanges that dates back to th century Feldman .
The picture above suggests that terrorists need the media to receive free publicity for their cause transmit their messages and garner support recognition and legitimacy. Given the emerging trends in the media and communications technology it is likely that terrorists will employ more innovative tactics to achieve their goals. The following section will discuss how the other side of the equationthe mediaportrays terrorism and benefits from it.
Needless to say terrorism is an attractive boon for media coverage mainly because terrorist attacks make viewer ratings surge and profits increase. To be more specific terrorism has many aspects that make it a very attractive subject for the media as it has the elements of drama danger blood human tragedy miracle stories heroes shocking footage and action Terrorism and the Media . Another reason is that violence is a central and defining quality in contemporary television culture and is critical to the semiotic and financial momentum of contemporary media organizations Lewis . Indeed the media has always been interested in reporting terrorism however the recent proliferation of television and radio channels and the emergence of megamedia organizations have resulted in greater competition and insatiable appetites for shocking sensational infotainment that is believed to keep audiences captivated boost ratings and circulation and increase profits Nacos . Also the part of the reason why the media is that irresponsible and excessively profitoriented in the context of terrorism is that a considerable number of top media executives today come from the corporate world but not from the ranks of journalists Biernatzki .
The problem does not lie in why the media covers terrorism but lies in how the media covers terrorism. It is by and large the case that the media covers terrorist acts by writing sensationseeking enlarging anecdotic stories especially on who is to blame repeating the same images over and over again separating physical and mental health consequences of disasters and creating new syndromes Vasterman Yzermans and Dirkzwager . In addition the media traumatizes the audience by exaggerating the threats or as it was in the case in the US after showing nonstop footage of combat scenes Long . In other words as Altheide underlines the politics of fear is a dominant motif for news and popular culture today. Moreover within this framework news reporting about terrorism is linked with victimization narratives that make crime danger and fear very relevant to everyday experiences Altheide .
To understand how the media portrays terrorists and covers related stories and news one should take a closer look at the mediums the media employs. The media generally uses agenda setting and framing to highlight and make certain issues more prominent than others. Agenda setting is the theory that the more attention a media outlet pays to a certain phenomenon the more importance the public attributes to such an issue Terrorism and the Media . Framing on the other hand is selecting some aspects of a perceived reality and making them more salient in a communicating text in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition causal interpretation moral evaluation andor treatment recommendation for the item described Papacharissi and Oliveira . Thus the words and images that make up the frame can be distinguished from the rest of the news by their capacity to stimulate support of or opposition to the sides in a political conflict Entman .
To illustrate this Muslims and Arabs were discussed and apprehended either as suppliers of oil or as potential terrorists after . Very little of the detail the human density the passion of ArabMuslim life has entered the awareness of even those people whose profession it is to report the Islamic world Nacos and TorresReina . In a similar vein the media covered the attacks in such an immediate way that through its lens the problematic effect was the death of thousands of civilians in an act of war against America the cause was terrorists and the remedy quickly became war against the perpetrators Entman . As both examples point out public perception may be negatively affected by the medias rhetoric its bias toward certain groups and framing of certain ethnic andor religious groups as terrorists and of events as acts of terrorism.
The media indeed profits from the drama terrorism creates and covers the terrorismrelated news in a sensational way. Through employing the abovementioned mediums however the media may directly or indirectly serve the interests of terrorists by simplifying stories for the viewer to the point that it has little to do with the actual events. Repeating the traumatizing scenes and stories may also serve them as the goal of the terrorists is to be in the media as often and long as possible. In addition the medias bias and obsession of sensationalism may help them get the upper hand in using media as a tool create an atmosphere and politics of fear and create ripe conditions for propaganda and recruitment following any terrorist attack. Given these it can be argued that the goals and objectives of terrorists are highly related to agenda setting and framing and that the way media covers news and stories has a crucial impact on the way terrorists communicate carry out attacks and gain a foothold in the audiences daily lives. The better terrorists understand this mechanism behind the media the more coverage they may receive and take further steps for massive publicity and the opportunity to showcase their ability to strike. One of the most remarkable examples of this the attacks will be examined in the following section.
Without a doubt the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and on the Pentagon near Washington DC were shocking global media events that dominated public attention and provoked reams of discourse Kellner . Obviously terrorists were aware of the fact that attacking the symbolic targets in the US killing thousands of citizens and causing a tremendous amount of damage to the American and international economy as well as the image of the US would be sensational news around the globe.
The response of the media in the US was often far from being objective calm and prudent. Instead media organs oozed hatred and hysteria calling for action against mainly Arabs and Muslims and crying for revenge as terrorists would have planned. The major corporate media tended to support the patriotic discourse and the policies of the then president George W. Bush who was leading the nation against the forces of political and cosmological evil Lewis . This way of media coverage after a traumatic event dramatically changed the public perceptions discourse at government and public levels and the way people perceive events and other people specifically ethnic and religious minorities who can be perceived as a threat. As a result as Altheide argues the discourse of fear has been constructed through news and popular culture accounts and the main discourse of fear has clearly become terrorism in the post era. In other words was used by the media and politicians to promote fear related agendas and ideologies. Citizens became accustomed to safety rhetoric by police officials which often required them to permit police searches condone overaggressive police action as well as join in a myriad of crimeprevention efforts many of which involved more human as well as electronic surveillance of work places neighborhoods stores and even bodies Altheide .
The picture above suggests that the architects of the attacks achieved their mediacentered objectives as the media conveyed the message that even the US was vulnerable to terror attack that terrorists could create great harm and that anyone at any time could be subject to a deadly terror attack. They also succeeded in immersing the US government in a global information war to promote the interests values and the image of the US Kavoori and Fraley . Terrorists were obviously aware of the magnitude of sensation their attacks would create however the way media covered news and stories rendered it possible for the terrorists to conceive an unimaginable victory in terms of penetrating into the daily lives of a huge audience. They attracted global attention obtained global recognition received a degree of respect among sympathizers and gained legitimacy in the eyes of supporters and potential recruits through the fear narrative the media employed.
Terrorism is a category of political violence which is intended to influence foreign and domestic governments as well as communities. Terrorism uses its immediate victims and material targets for semiotic and symbolic purposes Lewis . Attacks are designed to create an atmosphere of fear or a sense of threat. In the same vein terrorism can also refer to politically motivated deeds perpetrated by groups or individuals for the sake of communicating messages to a larger audience Nacos a. In any case the terrorists need for media publicity and medias need for a greater audience and profits form a symbiotic relationship between terrorism and the media.
This symbiosis is not inevitable. Implementing certain policies that are different than the previous failed policies can facilitate the breaking of that cycle by forcing at least one side of the equationthe mediato act in a more responsible more conscious and more cooperative manner. Only then starving the terrorists of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend can become possible and more robust steps can be taken to win the ideological and actual battle against terrorism.

The task of keeping a city or a country safe is one that very few people in this world have to deal with so who are we to second guess their decisions right Is troops a harsh response Would be better What about Its easy to Monday morning quarterback a scenario after its over but right now theres no way to know if the attack is over not for sure anyway and the governments priority SHOULD be protecting the people of Paris period.
Where things begin to get dicey is how and when all the current hightened sensitivity begins to dissipate or doesnt itOnce the threat has been contained and that is confirmed do the soldiers remain on the streets Are searches and military justice still sanctioned Recall the words of former Obama Chief of Staff Rham Emanuel never let a crisis go to waste. Its disgusting to think that conspiracy theorists jump immediately to the possibility of a false flag attack when there are families that dont even know to begin grieving yet BUT anyone who doesnt believe a government would fire on its own for what it perceives to be the greater good doesnt know history very well.
Earlier this week the United States did our best North Korea impression with the launching of two nuclear capable missiles. Just yesterday in a post titled Jim Willie Explains U.S. Nuclear War Threats to China and Russia Over Challenging Dollar Supremacy Jim Willie explained why the U.S. would risk nuclear war at this point. The world is a powder keg waiting to blow and events unfolding in the Middle East and Europe are at the heart of the tensions. Who knows what a government might do to rationalize actions it felt were in its best interests. Whether Paris was a false flag attack or not should be more evident in the days to come as we watch and see how the government responds. Whether it is or it isnt doesnt negate the fact that we live in a time that as citizens we have to be eternally vigilant of our surroundings if we expect to survive. That includes being VERY aware of what our governments are up to.
As France finds itself in the grips of martial law and its first mandatory curfew since it was occupied by the Nazis in there exists a number of questionable details surrounding the recent terrorist attacks in Paris.
Only hours after the first shots were fired stories and reports are beginning to change and contradict one another. Considering the history of the French government French Intelligence agencies and the AngloAmericanNATO Intelligence apparatus particularly the recent events surrounding the Charlie Hebdo attacks that were exposed as false flags one would be justified in wondering whether or not these recent attacks in Paris were of the same variety.
Below are a number of reasons to question the official story of the Paris terror attacks.
. How many gunmen Already the number of individuals involved in the Paris attacks is in question. While some reports suggested four shooters were involved others suggested three. The majority of mainstream reports seem to be only acknowledging two shooters. So how many shooters were there Two three or four One witness Pierre Marie Bertin a yearold who was at the theater when the shooting began stated that there were as many as four gunmen. Bertin described some male hostages who went onto the balcony and tried to negotiate for the life of their wives with one of the guys terrorists. It was sickening. Bertin recounted somewhat more detail than some other witnesses and was clear that there were as many as four gunmen. Australian news media is reporting that three gunmen have been killed.
This might seem inconsequential to many readers but in informed researching circles it is wellknown that the information that comes out shortly after the event is usually the most reliable. This is not to discount the existence of confusion related to panicked reports coming from eyewitnesses and the like. However the information coming out early on has not yet been subjected to the topdown media revision that will inevitably take place as the story becomes molded to fit the narrative pushed by the individuals who either directed the attack at the higher levels or at least have connections with those who are able to control the manner in which various media outlets report the event. For instance in times of false flag attacks the initial reports may point to gunmen. Very shortly after reports may only mention two. Only a few hours after the attack however all references to more than one gunmen are removed entirely with only the lone gunman story remaining. Any other mention of additional gunmen after this point is ridiculed as conspiracy theory.
. The types of weapons used While some reports suggest that the attackers were using AKs other reports are suggesting that shotguns were used. While the contradiction in reports can certainly be attributed to victims and witnesses simply not being aware of the type of weapons being used in the attacks and panic in the heat of the moment there is none the less contradiction in the reports being issued. As of the time of the writing of this article there has been no clarification as to what type of weapons were used. Since the assailants were supposedly killed by police it should be clear what weapons they used.
. Were the gunmen killed or arrested While the number of gunmen itself is in doubt news reports coming from Fox and Sky are suggesting that a suspected gunmen was actually arrested. In fact the suspect allegedly stated to police I am from ISIS giving us all the information we need as for who is responsible for this attack.
.Gunmen connected to ISIS gunmen connected to Syria Along with the very convenient and immediate statement by an allegedly arrested suspect that he was from ISISwe also havescreams of a shooter that This is for Syria This gives us all the information that we need regarding the motivation of the alleged attackers. They are from ISIS. They hate the French because the French are attacking ISIS and because somewhere in France in a very darkened corner under the sofa there are freedoms. ISIS hates freedoms. This is quite coincidental considering the fact that a Russian airliner was recently bombed allegedly by ISIS at least according to the West.
. The timing of the event Aside from the obvious connotations derived from the attacks occurring on Friday the th the Paris massacre has taken place shortly before a major climate summit that was set to take place in France. The French government was expecting massive protests they alleged could potentially become violent by activists opposed to globalization and energy austerity. Interestingly enough France had already planned to impose border controls starting on November th in anticipation of the U.N. Conference on Climate Change in Paris because of the terrorist threat or risk of public disorder. Needless to say there will be no massive protest now considering the fact that France resembles the version of itself more than anything else.
. Security Considering the fact that the security had been so heightened both on the heels of the Charlie Hebdo attacks and the anticipation of disorder for the U.N. Conference on Climate Change how on earth did such a major terror attack slip through the hands of the DGSE After all France is nothing if not a police state. It is also giving the United States a run for its money in the contest for how much information it is able to nab up on its citizens. No doubt we will be sold the line of precivilized savages outsmarted firstworld high end military surveillance states.
. Drills One hallmark of the false flag operation is the running of drills shortly before or during the actual attack. Many times these drills will involve the actual sequence of events that takes place during the real life attack . These drills have been present on large scale false flags such as as well as smaller scale attacks like the Aurora shooting.
Although one reason may take precedence over the other depending on the nature and purpose of the operation drills are used by false flag operators for at least two reasons. One such purpose is the creation of intentional confusion if the drill is taking place during the actual attack. The other more effective aspect however is using the drill as a cloak to plan the attack or even go live when it comes time to launch the event. Even more so it gives the individuals who are involved in the planning of the event an element of cover especially with the militaryintelligence agencys tight chain of command structure and needtoknow basis. If a loyal military officer or intelligence agent stumbles upon the planning of the attack that individual can always be told that what he has witnessed is nothing more than the planning of a training exercise. This deniability continues all the way through to the actual going live of the drill. After the completion of the false flag attack Coincidence Theory is used to explain away the tragic results.
All of this must be considered when one reads reports suggesting that the UK conducted counterterrorism drills earlier this year that included scenarios that involved terror attacks in Paris similar to those that took place on the Charlie Hebdo massacre. As the reports surrounding the UK drills were released a number spokesman confirmed it had been agreed that future exercises which take place on a regular basis should seek to learn from events in France. David Cameron himself stated that there was a need for police to call on military help if there was a major emergency.
.Charlie Hebdo The recent Paris attacks were similar to the Charlie Hebdo massacre that occurred earlier this year. The Charlie Hebdo attacks however were largely revealed as a false flag operation. Evidence for which can be seen in my article Signs the Charlie Hebdo Attack Was a False Flag. Thus there exists a clear precedent for such attacks in France albeit on a much larger scale
While the information presented above may not be enough evidence to conclude that the Paris attacks were false flag attacks it is reason enough to question the official story thus far. If these attacks are indeed placed in the lap of ISIS however all fingers should immediately point to NATO and the Atlanticist Intelligence apparatus. It is they who control ISIS and they who bear the responsibility for its actions.
Youve made some good points hereWell have to see how the followup is conducted over the next few days. Forthcoming information can then be more accurately assessed determinations probables can then be scrutinized. Its important we stay aware focused to events around usespecially from those who we have elected as our representativesRemember think criticallyask questionsfollow your gut.
What really messes me up is that I just spent the last three days trying to watch the movie Incendiary.
I finally managed to stay awake through to the end on Thursday night. The worst pat about the whole thing is that the movie has an attack in England and what I believe is a soccer game never see the game. Later in the movie a detective speaks of prior intelligence of the attack.there were supposed to be three.
This is a relatively old movie too.in it.a woman talks to Osama to start here healing process she talks to him because at the time the movie was made he was still alive. That is how old the movie is..
WellFalse flag or notI know we liberals current Administration have failed to close Americas borders and protect you and your family cant we all just get along No boarders language or culture. Now dont get me wrongI am not coming for your gunsonly your Constitutional nd Amendment right to protect yourself and your familyI meanyou can protect yourself but only if you use like a pillow or broom or something that will not hurt anyone right Now just because I ran a couple billion dollars in weapons to ISIS doesnt make me a criminal does it Well who the hell will convict me anyway 
I AM taking a break from the internet to do something here in Ancient India with Monks next year and than on to Ancient Syria so deleted my account on FET but forgot to post the 
Secrets Man was not meant to know Card and the videos to it if someone reading this could be so kind to do it for me on my Thread thankyou very much.
That dumb word kept going through my head today. I didnt know why and I was getting annoyed. Then it occurred to me that its a movie. I never watched it. It just popped out of nowhere today and it was really annoying. I probably scanned your post on the th but I didt focus on it. Now I think I am going to watch it.

You got it all wrong. Did you personally see the Horsemen Maybe you ride with them.It is ok to be wrong but best to get to the subject at hand and not throw disinfo around someone might think your a troll. 
They let the invaders in borders are wide open. The So called Refugees stated they are invaders and would create chaos.
Now they want to close down the borders. Wow little to late they are already here and apparently they have some serious connections.
All the the Star gates have been located now the Mid East Looks like swiss cheese.
Between the West Eastern coalitions they all have their share of alien technology. They picked up where Hitler left off searching the corners for the ancient alien artifacts.The Grey Aliens are easy to shoot down using Hyperbolic Particle Beam Radar refraction Gravity beams.The Old SS Elite Family has invested lots of time and now opening the portals to other dimensions.They are attempting to use these portals to change the timeline they now can place and extract people along any timeline although they have not worked out the paradigms and time shifts.UFOs are now old news The Eastern Western Coalitions have fleets of UFOs.Now the portals are the new devices and every country wants one. The Timeline wars have begun.No one could ever figure out what was really going on in the middle East Did anything make any sense Remember at first they said looking for weapons of mass destruction right.The Stargates is what they was actually talking about if you was not paying attention you may have missed it. Notice in the news a lot of Syrian ancient artifacts are missing these artifacts hold key clues and codes for use of the star gates.There has been attempts to open a portal to the WWII era to change the timeline this is why you are seeing mass influx of refugees in the current timeline.The Old SS family CERN now has put together an emergency think tank trying to correct their mistakes although it may now be to late there are to many variables.If your in a location near these portal test you have probably experienced identity loss and feeling very lethargic although people world wide are now feeling displaced.Europe has been in the main epicenter and even now the harmonic resonance has changed.Have you even questioned why all the chaos is taking place in the Middle East and now Europe is paying the priceThere are a lot of unexplained events happening world wide they have set off a chain reaction in time.You must have noticed by now your clocks have advanced and slowed down during these major events Portal Activations sometimes very noticeable depending on your locations.They keep activating the portals thinking they can repair the mistakes but it just making things worse.Soon Europe will not even be the same at all.

BUT I do know the negro has only about a year left. And they still are not able to declare the negro president for life so if this is a FF operation and one of DOZENS already they are doing a poor job of accomplishing it.
When they are able to declare the negro president for life it looks like more than a shootup is needed. 
I know just where this is going and whilst we have ISIS in Libya and Iraq the ones we will be told to go after are all going to be in Syria and the reason for that is it borders join with Israel.
Russia is doing an fine job in Syria of killing ISIS just like the USA said it had been doing for the past few years and now we know it was all lies.
if you have all the money in tte world like the jewish bankers own then its not to hard to find someone that will blow themselves up so the bankers can come up with a story to steel land at the bottom of the garden.

In all the objecting about islam it is NEVER shown why islam is not a religion islam is ONLY a political entity with a military arm. Its very simple to prove this.
The islam political machine claims that they are from Gods covenant with Abraham.
The severe problem here is that the koran rejects all manner of Abraham covenant writings like the below for example.
Does God have prophets who are liars against His Abraham covenant writings allah does not exist all the killing is in defense of pure nothingness
Who hath ascended up into Heaven and descended What is the name of His Son.
That they said in boast We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary the Messenger of Allah. but they killed him not.
When speaking of the throne of Peter or the throne the Pope sits on it says when the French soldiers under General Bonaparte took possession of Rome they found on the back of it in Arabic this wellknown sentence from the Koran There is no God but Allah and Mahomet is His Prophet The Two Babylons you will find the following on Page in Chapter Religious Orders Section L.
It is clearly a false flag in order to justify increasing military assets in and around Syria. Just one day prior to this attack the French air craft carrier set sail for Syrian waters and Syrian officials warned the French military that if it sailed into Syrian waters it would be targeted.Then a day later you have this with Hollande promising to strike hard against them along with Obama. It is so clear to see how this is all a set up
how is the False Flag coming along wait wait how is the Boston bombing False Flag coming along wait wait the moon landing next you will say the earth is flat or its hollow wait wait humans fight ET on mars and now drum roll please .Terrorist Attacks in Paris False Flag 
If this were a setup the President and the Secretary of State wouldnt have made statements just hours before the attack about ISIS being contained and their days being numbered. They were clearly unprepared for this attack and its a real embarassment to the Administration which has been claiming that its non policies are working to keep ISIS isolated in Syria.
Sometimes theres just evil people in the world who want to force their ideology on other people and kill anyone who disagrees with them. Thats radical Islam.
I was watching BBC America right after these terrorist attacks. Within minutes different reporters from sites of the attacks both reported live that they have no clue what was going on and that they were being kept in the dark about the situation at hand. One of the reporters even said that the soccer match between France and Germany went on as if nothing had happened and that they completed the game. The other reporter said he didnt see anyone dead at the scene.
The timing France Germany match is suspicious because Germany has the same problem with immigration.We France have declared war on ISIS and Assad. WTF we cant declare war and have no victims on our side.Take a look at the concert in Bataclan EAGLES OF DEATH metal here is the masonic signature.
I dont think the name of the band had anything to do with it. Its more likely that it was a target because its a confined space with more targets per square foot than anywhere else. You ever been to a metal show They pack em in there tight.Its odd though. Out of curiosity I checked the show listings for Bataclan and they had Deftones as the group performing.
The attack starts same time as the kiss the devil song. So I think the name of the band and what they sing is not a coincidence

It no longer matters if it was a false flag attack or not. The situation is now very real and no amount of posturing will change that.

So ISIS is attacking France because France attacked ISIS in Syria. Is France working with Russia who is helping Assad attack ISIS
Would that include sending weapons to The moderate rebels who are trying to remove Mr Assad or the moderate rebels who all defected to ISIS 
Things were going along just fine for Isreal untill Russia started to help Syria to turn the tide against the growning number of ISIS fighters taking land in Syria and now we have all this trouble.
We stand on the brink and allowing our government to now pretend Syria or Russia needs help in dealing with ISIS in Syria could turn out to be suicide regardless of who the press says did the attacks in Paris
See the seer sees your a nut job go and bake a gay cake your Muslim black president you voted in twice told you
Wrong on all accounts for your part. Be careful that ziofecal matter may stick to your teeth. Sucker.
Excellent a blind seer. John Cleese does a great rendition of a blind seer in Brother where art thou.
can you not think for yourself or do you always follow the crowd and say its a False Flag
barry was smiling and seemed very pleased about it. He loves watching unarmed citizens get mowed down.
Id love to see the world find out whos responsible for this false flag then have the entire internet rage and bring them to justice.
Just your weekly false flag so the elite can push their agendas on the clueless masses who believe everything they are sold no matter how many times they have been fooled in the past. Some never learn or get it and likely never will and the shills and trolls will be out in force on this one.
first things first is the supply needs to be cut off from ISIS i.e. eXon mobile and the other big oil barrens.
USA CIA Director meets with French officials just before attack. What could be more obvious of a hoax.
The Shared st Century International Mission featuring John Brennan John Sawers Bernard Bajolet and Yaacov Amidror
I believe that the president of the USA will take us to war very soon. It is Gods plan. However I am starting to believe that of these false flag posts are being posted by people who hate USA Christians and would say anything to justify their belief. No matter what happens their story is always it was a false flag.
Look. The French were basically neutral and this happens Now their going into Syria. Things that make you go hmmmmmm 
We have these hoaxes in the US all the time. Most of them are about gun control but not all.
Paying attention to the BBCs reporting some countries are definately using this as an excuse for something be this a false flag or not. No idea about other news corps but either the BBC is run by people who enjoy gathering round bloodthristy massacres or they have some other reason to repeatedly drone on repeating the same thing over and over again but Im sickened about how much some news corps seem to enjoy this type of event.
False Flag Are you for real This bloke Muhammad was one pissed off sand monkey on magic mushrooms smoking the reefer who was rejected from society years ago who was so full of hate that in his delusional mind he then wrote this book of hatred know today as the Quran. Now sand monkeys are known to smoke dope hence they sit around all day bludging on welfare payments and start reading the book of hate and believe its true cause as it sounds so good to them i.e. raping little girls and boys not to mention goats and camels infested with fleas and kill nonbelievers and be killed in the name of Allah to get the virgins in the afterlife.The attack on Paris WAS FROM ISIS MUSLIMS some were observed shouting Allah Akbar etc. It is written in the Quran to kill to lie to deceive. This Islam is a False religion it is the book of evil what God condones this No God only pure evil. May our father in heaven Bless all in France. My thoughts are with you all. God bless. Reasonable civilised people need to wake up and see what is happening around our world see that it all stems from Islamic beliefs. You need to stand up and say this religion shall not be tolerated as it is full of hate death. Read the Quran see for yourself.
Unfortunately ABBA ABBA you Gubermint creeps ONLY turn up in this sites recent posts after your Gubermint has cried out in pain as it has butchered people.
May God smite you with an infestation of a thousand filthiest of filthy fleas from the filthiest of goats and camels form the filthiest sand lands in all the world. May these filthy fleas infest around your crouch area for all eternity oh ye evil one.
Oh ye of the forked tongue DamnEl .blah blah blah WTF blah blah blah. In English please I dont understand a word your typing
FRIDAY the th Anniversary of the disbandment of the Knights Templar. Jacques De Molay a Frenchman leader of the Templars was tortured and executed. They like the number for some reason. Theyll willingly toss their own under the bus along with others because they love that number so much.
The rock band The EAGLES of DEATH Metal Who knows if this band had any clue. Im not going to say that they did. The Eagle could very well represent the U.S. and just the word death in the bands name would be of significance to the Satanists because they are all about being ritual.
This is a false flag to me because its not so much a religious attack but a political attack. If you think Satan worshipers arent the biggest politicians in the world and the least religious you are sorely mistaken. This mass human sacrifice was carried out under the GUISE of religion.
Now that bonehead BONO you know the musician that dabbles in politics and probably satanism with world leaders is saying that this attack is against music. That bozo needs NWO tattooed on his forehead. 
There is way more to this but I dont feel like seeking it all out right now. Its all out there in our faces if we pay enough attention. One person mentioned the geographical alignment of locations that were attacked and mentioned that they supposed lined up with the Belt of Orion and the pyramids in Giza but I didnt really delve further just yet. Im sure there is probably some significance there considering one location was a Cambodian restaurant. I dont know if that Cambodian restaurant is one of the locations or not. I do know that these mfrs dont pull anything by accident. I do know that we were told to do the math. We should also connect the damn dots as well. 
So to me this screams false flag. Yes people died. They dont care. They are all about shock and awe. There are Masonic organizations in practically every country you know. They have a bazillion names but they are all the same. You got the Fez hat I want a Fez hat just to be sarcastic wearing Shriners the Knights of Columbus Scottish Rite Knights of Malta Rosicrucians Order of the Eastern Star Order of Quetzalcoatl etc. 
This attack didnt have to happen but it did and some people sadly lost their lives because of a few bozo morons hellbent on performing Satanic rituals and sacrifice. Sadly many of those morons are in really high positions in government and society. Thats the worst part of it all. They are a bunch of numb skulls and they are pulling this bs on the rest of us. Are we all dead Asleep How come we keep letting these fools terrorize the rest of us continuously There has to be a point where we just tell them to stop. We have to do it collectively because if we dont they will pop back up like weeds.
So thats what I have to say about this real life horror. I had really bad gut feelings for the past couple of days leading up to this. It makes me mad.

you can always count on this site for posts about false flags while the bodies are still warm.
Yes indeed. However dear old Obama just accepted of those false flag waving to year old male refugees into the U.S. You know.the ones who are Sunnis from Syria who swear death to America every chance they get
So..I guess..when we have more blood spilled here in the U.S.and it touches THEM PERSONALLY they might just stop spreading their disinformation..when they realize they have been spoon fed b.s. ..and they ate it hungrilyasked for seconds and forced it on the guests.
Yes being canadian I am amazed at the lack of compassion and empathy from the BIN crowd. I have been watching updates on RDI RadioCanada in french and they get all their various updates from TV the french network in France. Last night the began showing photos of the deceased and gave short bios on each. These were REAL people with real lives hopes and aspirations not BLOWUP DUMMIESThere was also a segment on the recruiting of new terrorists year old girls. How they were groomed by their handlers to join them in Syria to become their wives. Terrorists ARE A CULT Nothing more a CULT THAT MURDERS innocents. One of the girls was stuck in Syria her brother went there to get her out in days he was only allowed to see her hour and ALWAYS WITH SUPERVISION of the husband. She WAS NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE.But then I suppose I shouldnt be surprised at the BIN crowd paranoid guntotingtriggeritching bigots always making every single MURDEROUS event a CONSPIRACY
I realize that there are real victims a real suffering that is taking place. I dont take away from that. If the U.S. was going to take in refugees then it should have started with the Yazidis who were stuck on the mountain and surrounded by ISIS and dying of dehydration being starved and those who attempted escape were raped and or killed.
Those are refugees. I dont see why those people Christians were left over there still at the mercy of ISIS and radical sunnis those who swear to our death from Syria are more welcome.
Not everyone on here owns a gun andor is a bigot. Paranoid maybe and rightly so. Yes this was a murderous event but it was a conspiracy false flag that can be traced back to Big MoneyBig Power. A bunch of Satanic idiots with extremely corrupt brains that are obsessed with ritual symbols sacrifices numerology and other occult crap. 
They are absolute nuts and the only way they can fool the general public is to dumb us down through distraction mindless repetition War on Drugs War for Drugs War on Terror War for Terror Common Core School to Prison or Fema Camp Pipeline probably and so on.
a false flag doesnt mean that nobody died however that the official version is completely flawed and the governments have their fingerprints all over
You would not know a false flag even if someone was waving it in your face you fools are so predictable its Not a false flag
Ooooh MI has spoken how unusual. But then MI created Mossad and the CIA AND HAS HAD A BIG HAND IN DIRECTING BOTH THEIR ACTIONS. Dont forget the royalty of Britain are khazars. and created both Saudi Arabia WW I and Israeli WW II and are now creating ISIS through Mossad to conduct all these false flags. We are not as stupid out here as you proffer in the protocols. Sorry about that. 
This is the hardest time you will ever have trying to start another world war to shore up your khazar zionist banker agenda. We are way tooo informed and educated now. All the false flags in the world may well result in the world attacking Israel. IS THAT WHY YOU BUILT A NUKE HARDENED BUNKER IN THE NEGEVE DESERT 
Fortunately Americans are armed and most are informed. Only the lazy still believe MUSLIMS HAVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG. The thoughtful KNOW ALL THIS IS BEING ORCHESTRATED BY ROTHSCHILD ISRAEL BRITAIN AND ISREALI OCCUPIED USA. SO VOTE OUT YOUR ELECTED REPS SINCE THEY ARE OWNED BY ISRAEL OR DEAD IF THEY ARE NOT.
Info comes down the pipes. M and other agencies have been infiltrated from the top down.There is now a new organization in charge. They also use a new cryptic style language and speak freely on MSM new outlets to send even the Most secret information to one another.Although there is a very old organization very secret people whom are in charge of protecting the real National security they are trying to regroup some claim they have a base in some cold region or even gone underground while they come up with a plan and they have a Super Star Gate and actively engaged in the Timeline Wars hoping to save the world.The SS knows people are easily mind controlled they use social media and MSM to employ Magic Mind Kontrol Techniques known as MMKT.Recently They activated a Star Gate Portal over Several large California Cities under the guise code name Trident.The Old SS Elite Family sent a well trained group to the past to obtain ancient Alien Technology before it got destroyed in the Iraq War. While in the past they used mind control techniques to be activated through DNA using analog communication waves in the future.The Tim line Wars are here Just as people dismissed aliens they will also not believe in the Star Gates or even question why the Middle East looks like Swiss cheese.
could you elaborate more on the middle east.the reasons of disharmony over there from your point of view

Amazon.co.uk introduced a corporate Solidarite logo movement the pages had the French flag and a logo replaced top right around pm GMT.
Just like to point out the attacks occurred .pm Saturday th given that there are several hours of confused reporting we are looking at a premature corporate promotion effort suspicious in that all employees in Europe and the US would not be at work save at the SARL depot in the Channel Islands warehouse. To get permission to make any changes to any logo would require permissions to be granted from management teams and a legal department as well as testing.

Under the domestic and international laws of war citizens are forbidden from taking part in a war on the side of the aggressor and are legally bound to disobey the orders of any Government that takes part in illegal war or supports acts of genocide crimes against humanity or war crimes. This duty to refuse to obey unlawful Government orders includes orders to pay tax Income tax Council tax VAT etc. If a government uses the funds raised by taxation to wage illegal war or to commit genocide crimes against humanity or war crimes then a taxpayers normal duty to pay tax is reversed and becomes a duty to refuse to pay tax.
ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Bomb Israel and this world terrorism will stop immediately. World peace is not in the interest of Moloch Baal and Yahweh. Sacrifice the minority and save the majority.
What I find interesting is that almost immediately after Obama Kerry and the pentagram came out and said Jihadi Johnthese attacks took place almost immediately afterwards almost as if it was a code word to attack. But I know that could Never be because the US INC has never ever done anything like that and has always told the truth to everyone about everything and of course speculating on such things will automatically get me labeled by all the liberal Truth Theorist brigade here on this site and in the US.
Theres no could be about this being a false flag event right down to the passport being left on the ground to be found. The fact that innocent people have been involved doesnt seem to bother the planners they will just spin it with compliant media. 
The NWO couldnt wait any longer for a legit excuse to destroy Syria because there isnt one and because their ISIS pals are getting pounded in Syria and are having to be treated in Israeli hospitals. This is threatening to spoil the atmos and finishing touches to their NWO carveup. due to take place whilst all the parasites are in Paris.One would be inclined not to attend considering that there are hoards of mad islamic murderers roaming Paris with abandon. But then again all the attendees know the script and the pigs didnt even look up from their carbon troughs.
The French think their air force is bombing ISIS training grounds in retaliation to this outrage against their people when in reality the French Air Force are bombing Syrias infrastructure killing civilians and hampering the progress of legitimate forces. Now French politicians are allowing their electorate to be deceived and pushed towards a scapegoat.those innocent SyrianIraqiLibyan migrants who most probably lost their homes and business thanks to French bombs. Dont look at what your govt is doing just keep your eye on those migrants eh
It seems the french put a lot more thought into their False Flag this time and if people die all the better for their plan to work but give it time and it will unfold the pass board was a major mistake but needed for some fast response bombing the lack of mobile phone flicks makes me think it was a massive exercise dont give me the people running for their life nothing gets in the way of a phone flick.

How could this happen this world is to perfect according to some of these losersWe are so stupid people arent killing people its all wrongIts made upTHESE IDIOTS ARE PHUKWITSNEED TO BE DRAGGED TO THE PHUKING MORGUETHEN BASHED AFTER WORDS
Who dreams up this nonsense Even the American CIA Director was in Paris to advise the French on how to do it.
In the photo where are the EMTsthe police the security If this were real the place would be crawling with officials. Where are the ambulance gurneys All we see are huge smears of fake blood. Its ludicrous in the extreme .
I was waiting for a blood photo of carnage and all I get are a lot of actors on a stage thats smeared with gallons of theatrical blood. Silly and very inept in the extreme.
Paris allready has a large muslim population so perhaps this was a real attack
Some countries in this world are beyond the film it all period. cellphone hypeIve been to several european countries where i didnt see any smartphones.. i know it sounds weird
This is the consequences of decades of wrong internal and external politics in France.Our leaders have been warned by internal and external sources for many years.
When you give the sword to the ones that want your death you cant be surprised if they do so.
Not every attack is a false flag take off the tin foil hat and show some respect for the dead and grieving
very strange cannot find my comments anymore things are getting suspicious they were deleted on BIN though accepted in the first place
If you write ANYTHING remotely sensible rational and logical youre shot down.
Just so a veritable war against truth and rationality. So bad they cant stand it Common sense gets turned on its head which is textbook blindness stupidity. 
The most interesting thing about this website is plumbing the depths of delusion mental illness spiritual blindness and Satanism etc. Its in the masses and the canary in the coal mine is gasping singing its not looking good for civilization in general.
Every attack is a false flag because our Governments are in on it all and if people do actually die its still not the slightest bit disrespectful to talk about the truth silence is disrespectful.With the whole world being spied on do you really think cocky terrorists who brag can go under the camera only if the authoritys want them too.
i tend to agreethere has always been cooperation btw. the past western world and the middle easternersmuslims latter created by the catholic church and so it is today being used as patsies for criminal activities as Barack aptly described it or war mongers. if they dont have anybody then they grab just somebody things are pretty much controlledbasically major events dont tend to happen out of the blue so who needs to be feared their agenda is crystal clear and has been pretty successful so far europe wont be able to survive its forced islamization without losing its dignity and U.S. involvement both in internal affairs and relationships with nonWestern countries so europe seems to be lost the U.S. obviously will only lose a lot prosperity and staged terror attacks in any city under way for invading muslims hating their hosts before they even arrive and increased poverty and servitude for native europeans
I have an idea of my own that popped in my head immediately after I heard about the attacks. I think that ISIS is America. I mean I dont think it was anyone from Syria but its America who sent in their men to attack Paris to start the new world war and get Paris on their side to take over Syria and drain it of its resources. I mean could you imagine the headlines America declares war on Syria after the attacks on Paris. The rest of the world will fall into the belief that they are heroes making them want to fight for America. Eventually this country will have so many armies fighting for them that our own military wont have to do anything. We just supply weapons and technology while sitting on the sidelines barking orders. Sure they may send out a few soldiers but not the ones that are vital to the war. The real soldiers are the spies undercover in the other armies driving them to do more than they have to. So when the war is over and nearly every country is bankrupt America will swoop in and take all of Syrias remaining resources and play good cop to the other countries loaning them money until their government is financially stable until America wants the money back and the other countries cant pay them. Leading to America taking all of the resources in those countries in payment until they are too weak to fight back.

THE terror threat in Britain is remaining at severe as ISIS supporters warn the UK is next in a series of unconfirmed tweets.
Supporters of the evil terror organisation made the chilling threats online after at least people were killed in Paris France last night.
Today David Cameron will chair a Cobra meeting where top politicans and security officials will be discuss raising Britains terror threat to its highest possible level.
If raised to critical it would be the first time since June that the threat to the UK has been so high.
This morning President Hollande confirmed the atrocities in Paris were carried out by ISIS describing the attacks as an act of war.
The news comes as the north terminal of Gatwick Airport was evacuated with many fearing ISIS had been true to their word and struck in Britain.
After gloating about the shocking attacks across Paris armchair jihadists claimed London could be next.
The twisted tweeters also claimed to have two other major capitals in their sights Washington DC and Rome.
Cops have raced to highprofile locations in Washington DC including the US governments Capitol complex amid fears of another .
London was last hit by a terror attack in July when commuters were killed by fanatics linked to alQaida.
But officials have reportedly been working nonstop to thwart ISIS attacks since the militants declared a caliphate last summer.
Last month MI chief Andrew Parker admitted the security service can never be confident in stopping all terror plots against Britain.
Following Januarys Charlie Hebdo attacks in France and the Tunisia tourist massacrein June the terror threat to the UK has remained at severe.
British people have been warned to expect to see a surge in police numbers at public events.
Mark Rowley the assistant commissioner for specialist operations in London urged the UK to be vigilant and report anything suspicious to cops immediately.
He toldBBC Radio s Today programme that terrorism can be defeated by strengthening trust within communities and the police.

If this face seems familiar its probably because youve seen it associated with any number of recent terror incidents. This man has apparently died at least three times since January most recently in the terrorist attack at Atatrk Airport in Istanbul. So what gives A France investigation provides the answer.
This same guy has been identified through social media as a terror victim in the wake of several recent incidents including the EgyptAir crash last month the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando and the deadly attack at the Turkish airport. Hes also been connected to other sorts of tragedies including an incident in Mexico when police shot at a crowd of people protesting education reform. But instead of identifying him as a victim social media users said he was the person who ordered the police to shoot.
All these claims are obviously false. Regrettably these social media shenanigans have been picked up by the media the mans photo is currently included in a New York Times video about the victims of the Orlando shooting. Following a BBC article about internet fakes and rumors an investigative team at France decided to dig a little further to find out who this man really is and why this keeps happening to him.
It turns out this mysterious individual may be a bit of a scam artistor at the very least a very shitty friendand this prank is how his victims are enacting their revenge. The social media users who crafted the fake posts all told France a similar story that they knew the man and he had cheated them out of money ranging from small sums up to . Our goal is to ruin his reputation said one of the perpetrators We want the whole world to recognize his face.
France managed to contact the person pictured in the photos but have decided not to publish his real name. Hes based in Mexico and admitted that hes currently embroiled in legal proceedings telling France that My photo is everywhere because of someone who started it as a prank after a legal dispute. He said he contacted media outlets like the BBC and the New York Times and asked them to delete his photo but they never responded.
So what recourse does someone have in situations like this In most countries laws on cyberharassment are still in their infancy. Existing media law can sometimes come into play and alleged victims can sue for slander or defamation. Penalties can be severe and even include jail time.
In this particular case the man has avoided any kind of legal action telling France that in Mexico nothing ever happens in these kind of cases.

An Australian counterterrorism expert has warned that the nation might face an inevitable terror attack from which even the government wont be able to protect itscitizens.
The military strategist David Kilcullen also added that Australians who think that the security agencies were capable enough to protect them from the attack were living in dreamland. The military expert indicated the chances of a terror attack in Australia during the latest episode of the ABCs QA. It is inevitable that we are going to see some kind of terrorist attack here in Australia Kilcullen said.
Gold Coast Bulletin reported that the above statement came from the military official following a question from the audience member where the person asked whether Australias approach to deal with the IS group was too cautious in terms of infringement of human rights as well as offending the nations Muslim population. To this Kilcullenalso added that the nation and its forces must be careful enough in addressing the issues properly.
Its worth remembering that the people we are dealing with ISIS specialisation is provoking sectarian conflict and getting different groups of people fighting each other so they can exploit that the military expert added. So while we do want to take a hard hand towards terrorism its really important to ensure we are not accidentally generating the kinds of dynamics that give rise to that sectarian conflict at the same time. It is a balance.
The federal minister assisting Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull Michael Keenan on the other hand said that the present manner in which Australia ishandling the issues isadequate seeing the recent attacks. Theres been three terror attacks in Australia two on our police one here in Sydney in Martin Place but our agencies have stopped a further six he said as quoted by News.

Fox News personalitiesare attempting to rewrite history in order to shift blame for the terrorist attacks onto former President Bill Clinton and away fromformer PresidentGeorge W.Bush whoGOP presidential candidate Donald Trump recentlyblamed for the attacks.The historical record shows thatthe Clinton administration was the firstto label terrorism a national security issue created a special CIA unit focusing specifically on Osama Bin Laden and ordered missile attacks against the terrorist leader while theBushadministration was warned times including allegedly byClinton himself about the terrorist threatprior to the attacks.
On September the Cabinet met and despite Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfelds insistence that Iraq represented the greater terrorism threat it approved Clarkes plan to fight alQaeda. On September the Senate Armed Services Committee recommended taking million from the proposed missile defense budget and devoting it to counterterrorism. According to Gellman Rumsfeld recommended that Bush veto such a move.
On the morning of September Clarkes antialQaeda plan was sitting on Bushs desk awaiting his signature. It was the ninth National Security Presidential Directive of his presidency.
When the Clinton administration received word of a potential attack in December National Security Council counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke notes President Clinton ordered his nationalsecurity adviser to hold daily meetings with the attorneygeneral the CIA FBI. As a result the leaders of those agencies instructed their field offices to find out everything they can find. It becomes the number one priority of those agencies. This vigilance Clarke suggests contributed to the arrest on December of an Algerian named Ahmed Ressam who was arriving from Canada with the aim of detonating a bomb at Los Angeles International Airport.
The Bush administration could have done similar in . Buried in the FBI and CIA Clarke notes there was information about two of these alQaida terrorists who turned out to be hijackers Khalid alMihdhar and Nawaf alHazmi. The leadership of the FBI didnt know that but if the leadership had to report on a daily basis . to the White House he would have shaken the trees and he would have found out those two guys were there.
Would that have foiled the attacks There was a chance Clarke argues but top Bush officials didnt take it. The Atlantic 
But it was Clinton in who issued the first ever Presidential Decision Directive labeling terrorism a national security issue rather than a law enforcement matter as it had been under all prior administrations including President George H.W. Bushs. In Clintons CIA created a special unit focusing specifically on Osama bin Laden. And in Clinton ordered missile attacks that narrowly missed bin Laden in Sudan and authorized covert action against bin Laden and his al Qaeda network.
At the time congressional Republicans slammed Clintons attempt to kill bin Laden as merely an attempt to distract from his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Many of them liked it to Wag the Dog a film about a fictitious president who creates a diversionary war to change the subject of conversation from his own sex scandal.
Indeed in one week after the U.S. Supreme Court declared George W. Bush the presidentelect President Clinton invited him to the White House for an exit interview. Clinton has said he told his soontobesuccessor that the biggest security problem facing the nation was bin Laden rather than Iraq but that Bushwas not convinced. Bush told the Commission that while he felt sure President Clinton mentioned terrorism he did not recall much being said about al Qaeda.
In the George W. Bush administration removed the terrorism czar from cabinet access rejected his request for a cabinetlevel meeting on bin Laden and took no apparent action on an August Presidential Daily Brief entitled Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S. ThinkProgress 
And I only raise the question because in part look at what the president put the nation through for seven and a half months. Look at the president that let his wife and all his supporters lie for him. Look at a president who looked the American people in the eye and who could imagine a scenario like this wagging their finger at them and said I want you to listen to me. I did not have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky.

Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham has spent months repeatedly issuing xenophobic rants against the perceived dangers of bilingual education in U.S. schools asserting that teaching students in more than one language in particular immigrant students whose home language is Spanish somehow contributes to a decline in school quality at a high cost. But Ingrahams claims about duallanguage learning ignore the wide body of research showing that fostering bilingualism and multilingualism in schools and teaching students in their home language as well as English can have lasting positive impacts for individuals and for the economy.

He is currently awaiting further trial.
Nearly years after there is little doubt that the nation is safer than it was on September . But the fact that the United States has thwarted at least terror plots since shows that terrorists continue to plan to harm the United States and kill Americans. Using lessons learned better counterterrorism mechanisms and new intelligence data are invaluable. Good leadership to keep America safe is nothing less than the American people deserve.

Share News Opinion Remembering victims of terrorist attack in Guyana years 
On January when most Guyanese would have been recovering from the festivities of Old Years Night revelries and New Years Day overindulgences food partying liming a group of cowardly terrorists brought chaos and death to the Rupununi region and affected the entire country.
These terrorists did not slink into the country from some neighbouring territory no they were all traitorous albeit Guyanese. It would seem that these mostly descendants of Scottish immigrant Harvey Prideaux Colin Melville disloyal Guyanese were not comfortable living within a country which had an AfricanGuyanese as its leader.
The conspiracy to secede from Guyana and form a separate nation was apparently planned by Valerie Hart who was married to one of the Melville descendants. She reportedly declared that the Rupununi District had seceded from Guyana and that they would set up a Government of the Republic of the Rupununi.
The devastating New Years news rocked the citizens of the fledgling Guyanese nation which was barely two and a half years old. The Cooperative Republic of Guyana had gained its political independence from Britain on May . The traumatic news was especially difficult for those of us who knew people on both sides of the conflict.
It was devastating to hear that young men with whom we had attended school were involved in the terrorist attack and murder of policemen who had been my fathers colleagues. We realized that if our family had been living in Lethem on January our father could have suffered the same fate as Inspector Whittington Braithwaite Sergeant James Anderson Constables James McKenzie William Norton and Michael Kendall .
Even more traumatized were the children of the slain police officers some of whom more than years later find it difficult to speak about the murder of their fathers by a group of traitorous disloyal Guyanese.
The reporting of the secession attempt named mostly the descendants of Harvey Melville as the ringleaders of the terrorist gang. In the s the large Melville clan and their relatives seemed to think that they owned the Rupununi. Melville had apparently entered then British Guiana as a prospector sometime in the s. He set up house with two Wapishiana sisters Mamai Mary and Mamai Janet and between the two women begat children.
The Melville clan expanded when those children became adults and had children. Melvilles eldest daughter Amy married American adventurer Basil Lawrence Ben Hart who entered the Rupununi in . Old Melville gave his daughter and soninlaw the Pirara Ranch and surrounding land and they begat six sons and one daughter.
All ten of old Melvilles children begat several children and they were all given land and ranches. By the s the Melville clandescendants was spread across the Rupununi savannas and included the Orellas Gorinskys and Harts. Valerie Hart was one of Ben Harts daughtersinlaw and named as the mastermind of the secession plot. She imagined herself a politician since she had been a candidate for the United Force UF political party in the Guyana general election of December .
However her days as a politician were numbered because five days after the terrorist attack on January she was expelled from the UF party because of her involvement and for acting in a manner inimical to the territorial integrity of Guyana and the aims and objectives of the United Force.
Hart fits the description of a traitor to her country of birth one who betrays ones country a cause or a trust especially one who commits treason since she knew that there was some tension between Guyana and Venezuela over Guyanese territory and she exploited that tension for her own gain.
Venezuela has claimed land in Guyana since the country was a British colony but they became aggressive after Guyanas independence. Hart was very aware of this and it probably pleased her little traitorous heart. The people who she oversawdirected and who would eventually attack the police station at Lethem and murder five policemen and two civilians received military training in Venezuela.
And there is more evidence to convict Valerie Hart of traitorous behaviour. It has been reported that at a.m. on January she contacted a U.S. ham radio operator and made an appeal for help on behalf of Guyanese rebels.
In a reported phone conversation with Jerimiah OLeary a reporter from the Washington Star she identified herself as President of the Association of Procedures and Representative of Free Peoples and the Free State of Essequibo in revolt against the government of Guyana and the government of then premier Linden Forbes Burnham. She appealed for weapons medical supplies and moral support and declared that she and her cohorts wanted to be free to rule themselves.
Hart made several other broadcasts that morning reiterating the appeal for U.S. or any other foreign assistance. She and some of her supporters were eventually flown to Venezuela where they remained for many years before drifting back into Guyana for periods of time. No one has ever been convicted of this terrorist attack and certainly Valerie Hart has never been brought to justice for her part in the attack on the Lethem police station and the murder of seven people in that debacle.
If she is still alive cowering somewhere in Venezuela this woman should be brought to justice. Most likely she has been living the good life for the past years hoping that everyone has forgotten the carnage for which she is partly responsible.
It was a horrific sight as described by eyewitnesses when early in the morning of January the police station at Lethem was blown apart by a bazooka attack. As the surprised police ran out of the disintegrating building they were mowed down by gunfire from the gang of cowardly terrorists.
As we see and listen to the grieving families and friends of the victims of the several acts of domestic terrorist attacks that have occurred in the U.S. this year I cannot help but remember January and the murder of seven people in Lethem Rupununi in the Guyana hinterland.
As we come to the end of we need to give thanks that we have survived in spite of everything that has transpired. The children of the police officers who were murdered by Valerie Hart and her gang of terrorists survived and lived to adulthood. No one knows how they suffered after their fathers were killed.
Humans have a great capacity for survival after suffering from traumatic events. Faith family friends and support systems help. We can give thanks in our various ways to whatever higher power we believe in and look forward to a time when we will not have to be reading about terrorist attacks.
We are almost at the end of and look forward to a New Year that will hopefully be less traumatic than . Happy New Year to all

An Australian counterterrorism expert has warned that the nation might face an inevitable terror attack from which even the government wont be able to protect itscitizens.
The military strategist David Kilcullen also added that Australians who think that the security agencies were capable enough to protect them from the attack were living in dreamland. The military expert indicated the chances of a terror attack in Australia during the latest episode of the ABCs QA. It is inevitable that we are going to see some kind of terrorist attack here in Australia Kilcullen said.
Gold Coast Bulletin reported that the above statement came from the military official following a question from the audience member where the person asked whether Australias approach to deal with the IS group was too cautious in terms of infringement of human rights as well as offending the nations Muslim population. To this Kilcullenalso added that the nation and its forces must be careful enough in addressing the issues properly.
Its worth remembering that the people we are dealing with ISIS specialisation is provoking sectarian conflict and getting different groups of people fighting each other so they can exploit that the military expert added. So while we do want to take a hard hand towards terrorism its really important to ensure we are not accidentally generating the kinds of dynamics that give rise to that sectarian conflict at the same time. It is a balance.
The federal minister assisting Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull Michael Keenan on the other hand said that the present manner in which Australia ishandling the issues isadequate seeing the recent attacks. Theres been three terror attacks in Australia two on our police one here in Sydney in Martin Place but our agencies have stopped a further six he said as quoted by News.

Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery Spent Public Money on IslamBashing Seminar
Get the most out of your experience with a personalized allaccess pass to everything local on events music restaurants news and more.
Few Americans speak with such frankness about political correctness radical Islam and Donald Trump as comedian Bill Maher. 
Through his standup act and his longrunning HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher the avowed liberal and sacredcowkiller has zero problem making his lefty pals feel uncomfortable as he challenges their preconceived notions of right and wrong.
In particular Mahers criticism of Islam has garnered a great deal of blowback from fellow liberals and mainstream Muslim organizations such as the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations which has labeled Maher absurdly an Islamophobe.
So in advance of his appearance at Phoenixs Comerica Theatre on Sunday at p.m.New Timesgot Maher on the phone to discuss Muslims Donald Trump encryption and why size really does matter when it comes to Islamic terrorism. 
And you know that Ted Cruz by the way had that prepared for months he said boy how Donald Trump got to the right of me on the Muslim issue so next time theres an attack guys we need something to come up with. And his presidential campaign had that ready for months. As soon as there was an attack they brought that out. OK were gonna one up you Trump were gonna call for surveilling Muslim neighborhoods. Hes just despicable. Anyway. No I dont agree with Trump but what I keep saying is if there is another attack especially and maybe even without it and the American people have to choose between that and a party that wont even say the term Islamic terrorism yeah I could see them voting for Trump. Which is a horrible thought for everybody worst of all for Muslims. 
Why do you think Democrats are so afraid of using the term Islamic terrorism I think the problem that Democrats have had in general in the lifespan Ive been following politics is that they dont lead they follow. They sense what their constituents want to hear and then they say it. Now Republicans I dont agree with their policies but Ill give em this they dont follow the polls all the time. They say well this is what the polls show well change it. For example the public option for healthcare was polling very high before Obama became president. Something like percent thought that was a good idea. And by the way it was supported by many Republicans. It is called the public option. Its just an option. Its about freedom. I thought they liked freedom.
So what they said is the polls show that this is high well well change the polls. Well meet in our secret lair and well get all our people together to say the same dumb talking points and well knock that approval rating down from to percent. The Democrats dont do that. . Democrats have this idea which I have been fighting against that Islamic terrorism is somehow if you say that term an act of bigotry. And theyre afraid to challenge it. So I would like to goad them into challenging it. As I keep saying I think Im the liberal in this debate.
Is this something you get into in your standup routine as well Oh yes. I mean I dont do anything in my standup that isnt chock full of laughs because thats what standup should be so we dont get into every aspect of it. But absolutely this is something that I relish talking about in standup and I think in the last few years Ive really turned a lot of people around. I think a lot of times liberals have just not thought about this issue all that much. I think they have this idea in their heads that Muslims are a minority and anytime you criticize a minority somehow you are violating some rule of liberalism. Whereas what Im saying is . if youre a liberal then you have to stand for liberal principles.
Im the son of two liberals. I remember what those liberal principles are. And its always being on side of the people who are the oppressed or the downtrodden or the put upon. And how you can be for blacks women gays poor people immigrants lettucepickers victims of police brutality you name it whatever the cause the bullied the molested the disabled and then look upon a woman who has to wear a burka a complete tarp over her whole body all the time and not see that as oppression is amazing to me because this idea that well its her culture she likes it. She likes it Thats what pimps say. 
What do you think about the controversy in France where a government minister over there has gotten into trouble by comparing Islamic veils to slavery I dont think you can tell people how to dress no matter what they want to wear. Obviously if youre taking a drivers license photo you cant cover your face though that has been tried. But the battle has to take place in a different arena than government . and convince folksthat they want to have the option not to wear an Islamic veil just the way that we have to convince people that theocracy is not the way to go that honor killings are a bad idea and that killing cartoonists killing people that leave the religion and wanting to murder gay people for being gay are all bad ideas.
Am I saying all Muslims believe this Of course not. But this idea that liberals have which is encouraged by Democratic politicians . that somehow its just a very small percentage the terrorists that believe illiberal things and the rest of the Muslims the whole religion has been hijacked. Well thats plainly not true. Theres an extraordinary amount of polling that they have done in the last five years that tell us we dont have to guess about this. 
Trump talks about it like every Muslim is a terrorist which is crazy. And the Democrats talk about it like its just this very small percentage which is silly too. And again we can look at the polling. A country like Indonesia percent of the people according to the polls believe in honor killings. So what youre telling me with that is that in Indonesia a country which many people hold up as a moderate Muslim nation almost out of people think when a woman is raped we blame her and kill her for it. Yeah you see I dont understand why the liberals get upset about that.
Some Muslim writers locally Phoenixs Dr. Zuhdi Jasser have expressed the opinion that the real problem is that the separation of church and state is not an idea with deep roots in the Muslim world. What do you think about that Right. Again. Heres something I said on the first show of our season which upset a lot of people which was it was our first show after the San Bernardino killings and following those murders I heard many people in the media talking about how Americans if they only knew more about Islam they wouldnt be so afraid. And I said actually its the exact opposite they dont know anything about Islam. And if they knew more you think they probably would be more afraid. And this is a good example of what you just brought up. I dont think people realize that in so many Muslim countries the separation of church and state just doesnt exist. I mean sharia law you know whats in sharia law some of those things I was just mentioning we cut off your hands if youre a thief we kill you if you are an adulterer or you have premarital sex or if you marry someone outside the religion. We kill you if you leave the religion. It varies from country to country its not always as bad as it is in Saudi Arabia. But again these are very very illiberal ideas. Liberals have got to stand up for liberalism else youre not a liberal. 
Something else you often hear among liberals in the aftermath of terrorist attacks perpetrated by militant Islamists is that theres no difference between extremists whether its an antiabortion extremist or a neoNazi its all the same. Once again this is pure ignorance. This is just again liberals talking out of their ass. Its them wanting to believe something and going by that as opposed to facts. Which ironically is exactly what they hate Republicans for doing. But look size matters. Of course you can always find an example of bad behavior in any culture. No one certainly not me is arguing that that the only bad behavior in the world is taking place in Muslim countries. What Im saying is size matters. And again we can quantify this. .The New York Times says there are Muslim militant groups in the world. . Okay there are Christian militant groups in the world on this order Of course not. 
So this notion that liberals always go to of you say something bad about Muslims and then I will say something bad about the Ku Klux Klan. Except the Ku Klux Klan is not trying to acquire nuclear weapons. When is the last time the Ku Klux Klan pulled off anything like any of the Islamic terrorist attacks I can name practically off the top of my head I can name four just in Europe in the last year. Its what they call a false equivalency. Thats a really annoying argument that they should know better than to make.
If we accept that Islamic terrorism is an existential threat to the U.S. then how do we address the issue of encryption and encrypted messages and balance that with freedom of speech the right to privacy and so forth Every single lawenforcementperson Ive seen talk about it in the last month or so has said were blind now. We dont know what theyre thinking. We dont know what theyre talking about. So obviously this is a problem that is going to have to be dealt with. 
We all want our privacy thats important. But I would maintain that the old rubric I think it was said originally by Benjamin Franklin or somebody like that somebody from that era who said those who would give up their privacy for their security deserve neither and did not live in the era of nuclear weapons. Im sorry but the stakes are just a lot higher. 
Yes wed all like our dick pics to be private but you know what if they become public its not as bad as a dirty bomb going off miles from where you live. And these guys are not playin. They are actively seeking it. We found out that those guys in Brussels were actively surveilling a nuclear scientist. They were either going to blackmail him or kidnap him someway to get nuclear material. And unfortunately there is a lot of nuclear material in the world. Which President Trump only wants to increase. 
Well that kind of ends on a downer. Laughing I would like to say that when I come to Phoenix my show is all funny and not all about this.

My friends and I were at a barricade near the stage on guitarist Dave Catchings side. Eagles of Death Metal started to play at p.m. They were fucking great and Im not saying that because of what happened. Maybe minutes minutes after we heard pop pop poppop pop pop. It was not like the sound of guns. We heard maybe shots before we realized it was very serious. I didnt see anyone get shot but my friend who plays guitar in my band Red Lemons saw the three guys. He saw the red and orange color of the fire coming out of the Kalashnikovs. I saw Jesse Hughes face and all the musicians ran toward the back so I said Lets get out. We went through the stage exit right to the street. My girlfriend and my friends fell down but they were able to get up. It was very scary but it was survival.
I saw Jesse and his partner Tuesday from the band Eagles of Death Metal and some of the other band members outside and we were running with them for a bit. We were running beside Jesse and I will always remember his face. We took each other and hugged each other. This guy was very . he didnt understand. Jesses eyes were turning a lot. He didnt say anything to me his eyes said enough. He just told his Tuesday Baby stay with me. Thats all I heard. He was in shock. The other band members didnt understand as well they were afraid. We ran a few hundred meters after I saw them I managed to grab a cab and thats all.
My friends and I grabbed a cab to the neighborhood called Le Bastille and went to our drummers place. We just couldnt sleep. We grabbed bottles of beer and whiskey and were watching the news. I was on Facebook and on the phone with my mom or my friends until maybe or a.m. We managed to sleep a bit. We went back to the venue at a.m. to retrieve my bag. The closer we got to the venue the more blood we saw on the ground. When we finished talking to the police passed a family of victims. I couldnt look at them. Adrien Di BonaRolling Stone
It was carnage. It looked like a battlefield. There was blood everywhere. There were bodies everywhere. I was at the far side of the hall when shooting began. There seemed to be at least two gunmen. They shot from the balcony. I saw my final hour unfurl before me I thought this was the end. I thought Im finished Im finished. I was terrified. We must all have thought the same. Eventually when a few gendarmes came in slowly we began to look up and there was blood absolutely everywhere. The police told us to run. Marc Coupris The Guardian
I was in the audience and I heard what sounded like a firecracker. It was loud but the gig was very loud and I thought it was something that was part of the show. I think lots of people did too. Then they started firing. I saw what I thought was at least two people then I fled. The exits were clearly marked and I just ran. There were wounded there was a lot of blood. Blood everywhere. Jerome Boucer The Guardian
It was horrible. There were so many corpses. I just cant talk about it. Anonymous attendee The Guardian
It was a bloodbath. People yelled screamed. It lasted for minutes. Ten horrific minutes where everybody was on the floor covering their head. They didnt shout anything. They were shooting people on the floor. Radio reporter Julien Pearce CNN.
I found myself inside the concert hall when several armed individuals burst in in the middle of the concert. Two or three men without masks came in with Kalashnikovtype automatic weapons and began shooting blindly at the crowd . it lasted minutes. It was extremely violent and there was a wave of panic. Everyone was running in all directions towards the stage. It was a stampede and even I was trampled on. I saw a lot of people hit by bullets. The gunmen had loads of time to reload at least three times. They werent masked they knew what they were doing they were very young. Julien PearceThe Guardian
We were in the middle of a concert listening to the music having a good time and then all of a sudden we heard gun shots. They were quite high pitched at first I thought it was a joke on behalf of the band. And I didnt actually believe it. And the shots kept going and going and going and people started screaming and people started ducking hiding behind the seats and the chairs. And thats when we realized we had to get out. There were lots of people panicking but it was still quite calm. A group of us managed to escape through a safety exit that was near the first floor of the venue. We were in the stairwell and they opened the doors . and we all ran out in the middle of the street escaping for our safety. Jenny Watson French via Slate
It was about minutes into the concert when I saw two men firing into the crowd with machine guns. I at first hid behind a speaker. The men were firing wildly into the crowd and even at people lying on the ground. Then I followed some people who were running out through a door to the right of the stage. It led to stairs but all the doors off the stairs were locked. We were stuck there for about ten minutes. There were thirty or forty people there. Then we went further up the stairs and arrived at the roof. We got out through a window and we saw a man whose apartment was in the building next door waving to us. We made out way over the rooftop and he let us in through his attic window. We stayed there until we heard the past police raiding the venue a while later. Frederic Nowak The Telegraph
It was chaos. I was on the right of the room in the Bataclan an Eagles of Death Metal song was about to finish when I heard the sound of explosions like fire crackers. I saw the guitarist take off his guitar I turned around and I saw a guy with an automatic weapon firing into the air.
Everyone got onto the ground. From that moment instinct kicked in. With each volley you try to get as far away as possible from the gunmen impossible to say how many it all went by too quickly. I tried with some other people to get onto the stage where there was an emergency exit on the right. And there it was chaos people were terrified pleading to survive and others pushed and pulled at us to get behind the stage.
We hid in a room on the right by the stage thinking that it was an exit but no. A member of staff in the room said that the emergency exit was on the other side of the room. We still heard shooting. After a few more seconds or minutes nothing and we saw people edging towards the emergency exit when I think about it the gunmen must have been reloading at that point.
All of our group then decided to cross passing behind the rear curtain. Then we found ourselves outside and ran towards the boulevard. We heard shooting in the street where we were but I didnt look back. I ran like all the world ran towards Bastille. On the road there were already many police in cars and motorbikes heading towards the venue. I went home Im OK. Others cant say the same thing. I wasnt frightened and Im not yet in shock. Im writing this so I dont forget. Anonymous Le Figaro via The Telegraph

TheKremlins decision tolaunch air strikes inSyria could raise therisk ofterrorist attacks onRussian soil security analysts said as themove increases themotivation ofRussiarelated supporters ofthe Islamic State toretaliate against Moscow.
As its forces waged security sweeps andreal combat operations inthe Northern Caucasus during thepast two decades Russia has been targeted byterrorists many times but inthe past months thesecurity forces have managed tocontain them atleast fromcommitting massive acts ofdeadly violence.
Islamists jihadis andextreme Muslims are toput it mildly not pleased with Russias interference inSyria andthey will be prepared insome way toanswer what is happening atthe moment Sergei Goncharov aterrorism expert who heads anorganization forveterans ofAlpha aRussian special forces unit told TheMoscow Times.
Russias Defense Ministry said Monday inan online statement that its planes had flown sorties inSyria inthe past hours andhad hit nine Islamic State targets. 
TheBritainbased Syrian Observatory forHuman Rights said fighters most ofwhom belonged tothe Islamic State had been killed since Russia launched its air offensive onWednesday Reuters reported Saturday.
InSeptember last year after claiming tohave seized aRussianmade MiG fighter jet ata military base inthe Syrian province ofRaqqa IS militants forthe first time openly declared war onRussian President Vladimir Putin.
This message is foryou Vladimir Putin These are theaircraft you sent toSyrian President Bashar Assad andwere going tosend them toyou. Remember that amilitant could be heard saying ina video uploaded toYouTube atthe time.
But thedecision tolaunch air strikes inSyria could be atrigger totranslate words intoactions experts said.
Around Russians mainly natives ofRussias southern predominantly Muslimpopulated regions ofChechnya andDagestan are fighting together with Islamic State militants inSyria Sergei Smirnov first deputy director ofRussias Federal Security Service FSB said last month.
Nearly all major terrorist attacks inMoscow fromthe Nord Ost theater hostage crisis in tothe twin metro bombings in were perpetrated bynatives ofthese regions. 
While those people are fighting inthe Middle East Russia is safer said Simon Saradzhyan aresearch fellow atthe Belfer Center forScience andInternational Affairs aHarvard University policy think tank.
As long as they are there thethreat of terrorism in Russia has actually diminished he said. The more militants Russia annihilates onthe ground in Syria thefewer will come back. 
But according toAlexei Malashenko ananalyst atthe Carnegie Moscow Center think tank thereal number offighters fromRussia andCentral Asia who have joined theIslamic State is closer to andhundreds ofthem have already returned toRussian soil.
TheRussian government stepped up security athome after launching theair strikes inSyria. 
Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that thecountys National AntiTerrorism Committee special security forces andFSB were onalert. 
They are constantly taking measures toprevent terrorist attacks Peskov was cited as saying bystaterun news agency RIA Novosti. 
Terrorists strive tohit symbolic targets andgenerate as strong amedia storm as possible. InRussia they have taken hundreds ofhostages including children sent teams offemale suicide bombers oncoordinated missions andtargeted Moscow. Theconcentration ofthe media including international outlets is thehighest inthe capital which is themost targeted Russian city outside theNorth Caucasus.
The likeliness ofa terrorist attack is very high andit will probably take place ina large city like Moscow tomake apolitical point. But we cannot know when said Malashenko. 
Previous attacks were primarily aimed atforcing Russias hand inthe North Caucasus not abroad andproved unsuccessful inpressuring theRussian government tochange its policies with regard toChechen separatists andthe radical Muslim underground inthe North Caucasus.
But terrorist organizations have often hit targets abroad inorder toforce foreign policy change such as the bombing ofcommuter trains inMadrid byan alQaidainspired terrorist group when Spanish troops were supporting theU.S. military campaign inIraq.
Russia has amixed record onnegotiating with terrorists thehostage taking inthe Stavropol region city ofBudyonnovsk in was widely seen as aturning point inthe first Chechen War byforcing theKremlin toreturn tothe negotiating table with Chechen rebels.
But since Putin took thehelm in there has been anunbending policy ofnonnegotiation with terrorists said Saradzhyan.
Putin stood firm inrefusing togive into Chechen separatists even after the Beslan school hostage taking that shocked theworld inwhich over people were killed more than half ofthem children.
Even if theIslamic State manages tostage successful attacks onRussian soil it will not change Russian policy in Syria Saradzhyan said.
Most analysts said theair strikes were unlikely totranslate intoimmediate terrorist attacks. However thedanger will grow if Russia is drawn intoa long conflict.
The question is whether theKremlin gets seduced intothe pattern so often visible when countries embark oninterventions abroad ofthinking one more push one more expansion offorces will make adifference Mark Galeotti anexpert inRussian security services anda professor atNew York University told TheMoscow Times inwritten comments.
Andwhile Moscows air strikes could eliminate some ofits enemies it could also sprout new ones.
Western leaders have repeatedly expressed concern that Russia is targeting not only theIslamic State but also U.S.backed groups like theFree Syrian Army.
Broadening its line offire toinclude moderate groups will not win Russia new friends andcould sow theseeds fora new wave ofviolence Saradzhyan said.
Inevitably these groups will develop grievances vis avis Russia andwill try toavenge he said. 
I also think that Russias involvement inSyria may be risky forOrthodox Christians who live inSyrias coastal region he added.
Thehead ofthe Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill publicly backed theair strikes last week andVsevolod Chaplin aspokesman forthe Moscow Patriarchate called thefight against terrorism inSyria a holy war.
The endorsement ofthe Syria operation bythe Russian Orthodox Church gives extra impetus tothe extremists Theodore Karasik asenior adviser forGulf State Analytics aconsultancy told TheMoscow Times.
The Moscow Times . . 
Contagion refers here to a form of copycat crime whereby violenceprone individuals and groups imitate forms of political violence attractive to them based on examples usually popularized by mass media. In the late s and early s for instance Palestinian terrorists staged a number of spectacular hijackings of commercial airliners exploited the often prolonged hostage situations to win massive news coverage for their political grievances and appeared to inspire other groups to follow their example. Although terrorism scholars government officials and journalists have pondered the question of massmediated contagion for decades they have arrived at different conclusions. Because of significant advances in communication and information technology and changes in the global media landscape during the last decade or so this article reconsiders arguments surrounding contagion theories and contends that various types of media are indeed important carriers of the virus of hate and political violence. 
On April th Timothy McVeigh ignited a homemade truck bomb that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City killing persons injuring close to more and triggering massive news coverage at home and abroad. Five days later the director of the California Forest Association Gilbert Murray was killed instantly when he opened a small package that had been mailed to his office. The enclosed message revealed that the sender was the mysterious person dubbed Unabomber by the FBI he had killed already two other people and injured via mail bombs since . That same day The New York Times received a letter from the Unabomber threatening another deadly parcel bomb mailing unless the newspaper published a words manifesto he had written to explain his motives. It is difficult to imagine that there was no link between the nonstop coverage of the terrorist spectacular in Oklahoma City and the timing of the simultaneous mailings to Murrays office and the Times. My guess was then and is now that the Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski was miffed because of the relatively modest news coverage his mail bombs had received over the years compared to the tremendous attention the mass media paid to the Oklahoma City bombing. More importantly whereas McVeighs grievances and motives were prominently covered since he had intentionally posited clues in his car i.e. Waco Ruby Ridge there had been no definitive news about the Unabombers motives in the wake of his long mail bombing trail. 
Thus Kaczynski wasted no time to finally get his share of media attention and recognition of his cause by sending off another mail bomb and a threatening letter to the countrys leading newspaper. By September when The Washington Post also published his fulllength manifesto Industrial Society and Its Future sharing the printing costs with The New York Times the Unabomber had already overtaken McVeigh as terrorist newsmakerinchief seeing finally his grievances widely publicized and discussed in the mass media. It can be plausibly argued that the deadly mail bomb the letter to the Times a followup threat to bomb the Los Angeles airport contained in a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle and a host of demands and threats communicated to several newspapers and magazines were indeed inspired by the high volume and nature of news coverage about the Oklahoma City bombing in order to get comparable coverage. However it is in this case impossible to prove mediarelated contagion unless the imprisoned perpetrator Kaczynski himself were to confirm such a contagion effect. While this case speaks to the difficulty of finding conclusive evidence for direct mediainduced contagion with respect to terrorist acts it encourages the exploration of media coverage of terrorist incidents methods and most importantly ideologies as a vector of terrorist infection. In the following I revisit the media contagion hypothesis as it relates to terrorism and to a lesser extent for comparative purposes to violenceascrime. 
Contagion theories have been forwarded and rejected with respect to terrorism for several decadesoften in the context of media effects. While some scholars deny such a causeeffect relationship the notion of massmediated contagion seems commonsensical and is indeed supported by anecdotal accounts as well as more systematic research. 
However more than twenty years ago Robert G. Picard attacked the newsascontagion theory as backed by dubious science and argued the literature implicating the media as responsible for the contagion of terrorist violence has grown rapidly but under scrutiny it appears to contain no credible supporting evidence and fails to establish a causeeffect relationship. He cited the minimal press effect findings of social scientists in the s and s in support of his rejection of the media contagion theory. What he failed to mention was that ample and far from dubious research conducted since the s which found far stronger media effects on audiences most notably with respect to agenda setting framing and priming than the minimal effect school.
Writing with Northern Ireland and domestic UK terrorism in mind Schlesinger Murdock and Elliott too rejected the idea that the media are spreading the virus of political violence claiming that it ignored the intelligence and good judgment of news consumers and especially television audiences. 
However based on their quantitative analysis of media reporting or nonreporting of terrorist incidents and subsequent terrorist strikes of the same type i.e. hijackings kidnappings Gabriel Weimann and Conrad Winn concluded that their data yielded considerable evidence of a contagion effect wrought by coverage. More specifically these scholars found that television coverage was associated with a shortened lag time to emulation in the case of kidnapping attacks on installations hijackings bombings and assassinations. 
Alex P. Schmid and Janny de Graaf concluded in their study Violence as Communication that the media can provide the potential terrorist with all the ingredients that are necessary to engage in this type of violence. They can reduce inhibitions against the use of violence they can offer models and knowhow to potential terrorists and they can motivate them in various ways. Similarly Brian Jenkins wrote Initial research tentatively suggests that heavy media coverage of hijackings kidnappings and other hostile seizures carried out by terrorists increases the likelihood that similar incidents will occur in the period immediately following. A RAND analysis of embassy seizures during the s showed them occurring in clusters clearly suggesting a contagion effect.
Assumptions or inferences about contagion in the area of violent crimes are often based on observations and statistical data in the context of particularly horrific incidents. For example Berkowitz and Macaulay studied crime statistics in the aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in and subsequent to two mass killings in when Richard Speck killed eight nurses in Chicago and Charles Whitman shot persons from a tower at the University of Texas. The researchers found that statistical and graphic data from U.S. cities indicate that those incidents were followed by unusual increases in the number of violent crimes. While the scholars characterized theses cases as widely published crimes and implied a relationship between heavy news coverage of the three incidents and subsequent jumps in the number of violent crimes they did not argue that most such crimes are instigated by media reports. 
More recently Loren Coleman explored the links between the Columbine school shooting in when high school students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed and injured fellow students and some similar incidents in the following years including the Virginia Tech campus shooting in when student SeungHui Cho killed people and wounded many others. In many of these cases the killers revealed the copycat nature of their violence by referring directly or indirectly to the Columbine massacre. In Colemans words The copycat effect is what happens when the media makes an event into a hot death story and then via behaviour contagion more deaths suicides murders and more occur in a regularly predictive cycle. 
Despite the vast volume of published literature that has concluded that the causal link between media violence and antisocial behaviour is established there have been more cautious and even dissenting voices that have challenged the strong effects position. Some writers have accepted that media violence can influence viewers but not all the time and not always to the same degree in respect of different members of the audience.
As for massmediated diffusion of terrorism the strongest arguments against connections between media content and terrorist incidents are made by those who fear that the notion of the media as agent of terrorist contagion will strengthen the hands of governments in efforts to curb or alter terrorismrelated content and thereby interfere with freedom of the press and freedom of expression. I share those concerns and oppose censorship categorically. Yet these concerns must not prevent us from considering possible connections between media content and terrorism contagion and search for mitigating factors without media restrictions from government or other outside bodies. 
What is perhaps the mostcited example for mediarelated contagion of violence or the threat thereof is the case of D.B. Cooper. In November he hijacked a commercial airliner on the flight from Portland to Seattle under the threat of detonating a bomb in his briefcase. After receiving a ransom and two parachutes at the SeattleTacoma Airport and ordering the crew to fly at the lowest possible altitude to Las Vegas he jumped out of the plane never to be seen again. In the wake of heavy media coverage and the release of songs and a motion picture devoted to his daredevil heist Cooper became a cult hero. More importantly he inspired a series of more than two dozen copycat hijackings by other criminals during which the hijackers also asked for ransom money and parachutes along the lines of Coopers deed. 
As for political terrorism some of the best evidence of contagious media content comes from the testimony of captured terrorists or exterrorists themselves. According to two scholars Horst Mahler one of the founders of the German Red Army Faction RAF recalled years later how television newscasts had triggered the shockwhich led to selfliberationand the basis for RAF ideology. Several biographical studies of terrorists show that many were motivated by a desire to emulate the publicity achievements of precursors. Another example is that of South Moluccan nationalists who hijacked trains in the Netherlands on two occasions in the s to dramatize the Indonesian occupation of their fathers homeland the South Moluccas. They reportedly admitted after their arrest that their deeds were inspired by a similar attack plotted by Arab terrorists en route to Austria. 
In the case of the South Moluccan train hijackers media reports affected simply what method of attack the group would selected as most likely to succeed from what one would assume were several options the extremists considered. This appears to be a quite common mediarelated contagion effect that explains why particular modes of terrorist attacks tend to come in clusters or waves. Thus beginning with the hijacking of commercial airliners by Palestinian terrorists in the late s who in turn were probably inspired by a wave of hijackings from and to Cuba other Palestinian and nonPalestinian groups followed suit so that there was a cluster of hijackings with passengers held hostage. This method remained attractive into the s and beyond. Yet as airlines and governments improved their security systems the takeover of planes became more risky. While terrorists continued to hijack planes and in the case of the Achille Lauro even a cruise ship it was no longer the preferred method of attack. Instead terrorist groups embraced other means of attacking different targets and victims e.g. embassy takeovers.
Based on incident data collected by the RAND Corporation Brian Jenkins found that successful embassy takeovers and five unsuccessful attempts occurred between and in countries targeting the embassies of many countriesalbeit most of all those of the United States and Egypt. Like many other tactics of terrorism hostagetaking in embassies appears to be contagious Jenkins concluded. The incidents do not fall randomly throughout the decade but occur in clusters. It is plausible to argue that one event inspired the next especially if successful. Presumably terrorists learned about these takeovers most of them successful from media reports since these incidents took place in a host of different countries on different continents. By late when the Iran Hostage Crisis began the students who took over the U.S. embassy in Teheran and the Iranian leaders who backed them must have known via news accounts about the prominent news coverage such incidents received. After all of the embassy takeovers during the s more than half occurred in the last two years of the decade. 
As the insurgent speaks the graybearded man identified as Mr.Armstrong appears to be sobbing a white blindfold wrapped around his eyes. He is wearing an orange jumpsuit. The masked man then pulls a knife grabs his head and begins slicing through the neck. The killer places the head atop the body before the video cuts to a shot of him holding up the head and a third more grainy shot showed the body from a different angle. 
It is likely that the global wave of shock and outrage ignited by Bergs beheading inspired the decapitation of other hostages as a novel method of spreading terror from the Middle East. Indeed there were a number of cases in which terrorists beheaded their victims or threatened to do so outside the Middle East. In Haiti for example the bodies of three headless policemen were found they were victims of local terrorists who called their action Operation Baghdada label that had no previous meaning in Haitis civil strife except for the cruel method of murder copied from in Iraq. In another case of imitation the beheading of a Buddhist official in a village in Thailand was described as an act of revenge for violence against Muslim rioters. After the shooting of the critical Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh his killer tried to cut his throat as well selfproclaimed jihadis in the Netherlands threatened to decapitate other critics of Muslim extremists. All of these perpetrators had recognized the shockvalue and media attractiveness of this particularly gruesome terrorist tactic first performed for public consumption in Iraq. 
We can discern the direct patronclient and indirect through observation influences of suicide terror. In some instances insurgent factions have been physically trained by other organizations and taught how to best use horrifying tactics to devastating effect who subsequently import the tactic far and wide. On other occasions factions observe the successful operations of groups from afarbecause of the publicity and media attention engendered by spectacular bombings and then tailored the techniques to suit local circumstances. 
While suicide terrorism spread inside and outside the Middle East well before it became an even more popular weapon since . Examining possible reasons for the post wave of suicide terrorism Paul Marsen and Sharon Attia argued that the media cannot cause suicide bombings any more than sex as opposed to HIV can cause AIDS but they also suggested that media might be a vector of transmission that can precipitate its spread. Considering the publicity success of the attacks from the perspective of Al Qaeda and the organizations supporters and sympathizers in an article published in I pointed to the likelihood of spectacular homicidesuicide attacks becoming a mostattractive model for future acts of terrorism in one form or the other. While nobody has repeated the flyingofcommercialairlinersintobuildings scenario on a similar scale so far there have been many spectacular homicidesuicide attacks since in different countries and continents. 
To summarize besides personal contacts and cooperation between various groups mass media reports are the most likely sources of information about the efficacy of terror methods and thus important factors in the diffusion of terrorist tactics. Interestingly based on their analysis of terrorist incidents in the s and s around the globe Midlarsky Crenshaw and Yoshida concluded that some terrorist methods of attacks hijackings kidnappings and bombings were more contagious than others assassinations raids. These scholars recognized also that publicity provided by the news media was a factor in terrorists decision to imitate terrorist methods deemed effective. As they put it Visible and unusual violence is in essence newsworthy and attracts international publicity necessary for crossregional and crosscultural spread. 
A particular terrorist technique is only of interest to a group that has already made the decision to adopt a terrorist strategy a technique cannot on its own cause a resort to terrorism. Similarly a radical group will normally enter into direct contact with an established terrorist group only once the decision to adopt a terrorist strategy has already been made.
Inspirational contagion is more alarming for the targets of terrorism because it is the stuff that makes terrorists tick and leads to the formation of new organizations and cells. The abovementioned recollection of one of the Red Army Factions founders Horst Mahler about the crucial role of televised terrorism news in formulating his groups ideology and the RAFs raison detre might not have been a surprise for Midlarsky Crenshaw and Yoshida whose data analysis revealed the spread of terrorist thought from the Third World and particularly from LatinAmerican and Palestinian terrorist leaders and groups to Western Europe in the early s. Noting that radicals in Germany and elsewhere in Western Europe received this sort of inspirational information from the mass media the three scholars figured that physical contacts for example between RAF and Palestinian groups followed rather than preceded the decision to adopt terrorism.
Writing more than a quarter century later and considering David Rapoports categorization of four global waves of terrorism Mark Sedgwick suggested
Contagion is possible at two levels and can happen in two ways. On one level a group might copy a particular terrorist technique and on another level a group might copy a general terrorist strategy. Either of these might happen directly or indirectly. All these forms of contagion take place. The primary form however is the adoption of a general terrorist strategy without direct contact. All other forms of contagion are secondary to this. 
The Islamist terror networks of the twentyfirst century are becoming more fluid independent and unpredictable entities than their more structured forebears who carried out the atrocities of . The present threat has evolved from a structured group of al Qaeda masterminds controlling vast resources and issuing commands to a multitude of informal local groups trying to emulate their predecessors by conceiving and executing operations from the bottom up. These homegrown wannabes form a scattered global network a leaderless jihad. 
In the first decade of the new millennium the Internet has become the agent of virtual inspirational contagion spread by a multitude of extremist web sites with chat rooms and message boards that condition and inspire especially vulnerable young men and increasingly women within the Muslim world and in the diaspora to form or join autonomous groups or cells and plot terrorist strikes. 
But other kinds of ideologies of hate and terror are also disseminated via old and new media and communication technologies. There can be little doubt that the inspirational virus is particularly potent when diffused through media forms that are not subject to checks by the traditional media gatekeepers. It is for this reason that inspirational contagion spreads faster and further via books CDs and of course the Internet.
Timothy McVeigh was inspired by the extremist antigovernment and White Supremacy doctrines of the militia movement neoNazi groups and Christian Identity cells as these were synthesized by William Pierce the founder of the neoNazi National Alliance. Using the pseudonym Andrew McDonald Pierce published the novel The Turner Diaries that describes an all out race warstarting with the bombing of FBI headquarters in Washington. McVeigh and Pierce did not have any personal contact. Yet The Turner Diaries was the book that inspired McVeighs extremist worldview and at the same time served him as a blueprint for the actual bombing plot. His accomplice Terry Nichols was inspired by another novel Hunter authored by Pierce under the McDonald name that was just as racist and violent as The Turner Diaries.
Or take the extremist fringe in the antiabortion movement that uses web sites to spread its hateful agenda in the name of God displaying gruesome pictures of bloody fetuses of butchered children. They publicize the names and locations of abortion providers celebrating the murderers of abortion providers as inspirational heroes and role models. They also cites from the bible to spread the word that God is on the side of those who serve as soldiers in the Baby Liberation Army. After Dr. George Tiller a physician who provided legal abortions in Wichita Kansas was shot in May during a Sunday morning service in his church by Scott Roeder it was revealed that the killer had been a frequent visitor to several of the most notorious antiabortion websites. On one occasion he had posted a message on a fake Tiller.com web site that labeled Dr. Tiller the concentration camp Mengele of our day who needs to be stopped before he and those who protect him bring judgement upon our nation. It is likely that he took this comparison from the Army of Gods andor similar web sites that vilified Tiller by comparing him to Dr. Josef Mengele a Nazi physician in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Not surprisingly The Army of God praised Roeders killing of Tiller the Killer on its web site and demanded that Roeder must be found not guilty since he faced a terrible evil 
In conclusion when it comes to international and domestic terrorism various kinds of media figure quite prominently in both tactical and inspirational contagion. While the Internet has moved centerstage in this respect during the last decade the targets of terrorism have not been able to effectively counter the massmediated virus of this form of political violence. Recognizing this U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said 
Public relations was invented in the United States yet we are miserable at communicating to the rest of the world what we are about as a society and a culture about freedom and democracy about our policies and our goals. It is just plain embarrassing that alQaeda is better at communicating its message on the internet than America. As one foreign diplomat asked a couple of years ago How has one man in a cave managed to outcommunicate the worlds greatest communication society 
Speed agility and cultural relevance are not terms that come readily to mind when discussing U.S. strategic communications.

However the idea of imitating the attacks has been discussed among terrorists. Thus the Colombian FARC wanted to fly a plane into the presidential palace during President Alvaro Uribes inauguration but was unable to find a pilot willing to dye for the causeeven though the organization offered to give the suicide pilots family a million reward. Incidentally there was what looked very much like a copycat suicide with a small plane taking place in Milan Italy when the pilot crashed his plane in the Pirelli Tower on April .

The worst of the attacks occurred at the Bataclan theater where multiple gunmen stormed the concert venue. The attack came as the American band Eagles of Death Metal were playing inside.
Several armed men came into the concert. Two or three men not wearing masks came in with what looked like Kalashnikovs and fired blindly on the crowd Europe journalist Julien Pierce told the BBC.
It lasted between and minutes. It was extremely violent and there was panic. The attackers had enough time to reload at least three times. They were very young.
