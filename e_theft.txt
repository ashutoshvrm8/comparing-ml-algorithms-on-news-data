Brandon police are looking for suspects after a brazen snowmobile theft. Riley LaychukCBC 
A Brandon resident received an unexpected summertime surprise after following a trail to find their stolen snowmobile.
Police said sometime overnight on Thursday a suspect dragged the snowmobile from a back yard on the block of Park Avenue into a back lane.
Although the weather was more conducive to sunrays than snowflakes the suspect started the snowmobile up and drove north down the back lane.
When the homeowner realized his winter recreation vehicle had disappeared he followed the seasonally unusual tracks towards Victoria Avenue.The snowmobile tracksjumped a centre median before continuing down another back lane.
The suspect may have finally realized it was the wrong season for snowmobiling because the homeowner found the vehicle abandoned in a back lane just north of Rosser Avenue.
There was some damage to the hood of the snowmobile and officers towed it to the police station for a forensic examination.
Police said there are no suspects in the brazen theft and the investigation is continuing.

Your suitcase has been tagged and whisked away for a TSA security check before being loaded onto a plane en route to your final destination. How safe are the belongings inside The TSA has fired nearly employees for allegedly stealing from travelers and for the first time the agency is revealing the airports where those fired employees worked.
Newly released figures provided to ABC News by the TSA in response to a Freedom of Information Act request show that unsurprisingly many of the countrys busiest airports also rank at the top for TSA employees fired for theft.
Sixteen of the top airports for theft firings are also in the top airports in terms of passengers passing through.
At the head of the list is Miami International Airport which ranks twelfth in passengers but first in TSA theft firings with employees terminated for theft from through December . JFK International Airport in New York is second with firings and Los Angeles International Airport is third with firings. JFK ranks sixth in passenger traffic while LAX is third. Chicago while second in traffic ranked th in theft firings.
The four airports listed in the TSAs top list of employee firings for theft that arent also among the FAAs top for passenger activity are Salt Lake City International Washington Dulles Louis Armstrong New Orleans International and San Diego International.
. DallasFort Worth International Airport and New YorkLaguardia Airport each
. Newark Liberty Philadelphia International and SeattleTacoma International airports each
. HoustonGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport and Salt Lake City International Airport each
. Detroit Metro Airport and Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport 
. BostonLogan International Denver International and San Diego International airports 
During a recent ABC News investigation an iPad left behind at a security checkpoint at the Orlando airport was tracked as it moved miles away to the home of the TSA officer last seen handling it.
Confronted two weeks later by ABC News the TSA officer Andy Ramirez at first denied having the missing iPad but ultimately turned it over after blaming his wife for taking it from the airport. Ramirez was later fired by the TSA.
The iPad was one of ten purposely left behind at TSA checkpoints at major airports with a history of theft by government screeners as part of an ABC News investigation into the TSAs ongoing problem with theft of passenger belongings. The other nine iPads were returned to ABC News after being left behind.
The agency disputes that theft is a widespread problem however saying the number of officers fired represents less than onehalf of one percent of officers that have been employed by TSA.
SEATTLE King County prosecutors say they have charged a mother and daughter with being the ringleaders of a large organized identity theft ring that was busted last Friday.

Rockstar had plans to make Grand Theft Aut Tokyo and even carried out a reference trip for the game techradar has learned.
Rockstar visited the Japanese capital several years ago to assess its potential for a full GTA game but ultimately pulled the plug on the idea according to a source close to the company.
Before working on a new game Rockstar carries out reference trips to take pictures meet locals and generally get a feel for the area.
Our source said that Rockstar was serious about the idea of making a Tokyo version around the time of GTA and Vice City however the road system was seen to be problematic and became one reason the idea was canned.
Our source added that as time has gone on Rockstar has realised the difficulty in moving Grand Theft Auto outside of the USA where it has firmly embedded itself. There are a number of series staples from brands to cars that Rockstar would likely have to change if a future GTA was set somewhere else.
The source also revealed that preliminary work has begun on Grand Theft Auto but said a location had not yet been settled on.
Its not unusual that Rockstar would begin laying the early foundations for its next Grand Theft Auto so soon Its been more than two years since the initial release of GTA .
As for the more immediate future theres a lot of speculation that next Red Dead game will be revealed this year but theres a big question over where it could be the first to use a new Rockstar engine. In Rockstar put out a job advert for a position working on engine development for nextgen systems.
This is an exciting opportunity to develop cuttingedge architectures and high performance systems for current and nextgen platforms it read hinting that a new engine might be in the works. Even if Red Dead Redemption doesnt use it theres a very good chance that GTA will.
We asked Rockstar for comment on this story but did not receive a reply. Well update if we hear anything.

Algorithms Identity and Society was held before a capacity audience at MITs Bartos Theater and sponsored by MITs noted program in Science Technology and Society.
Luciano Floridi speaks at the event Algorithms Identity and Society on April .
Media can only be downloaded from the desktop version of this website.
The vast global trend toward computerdriven automation is usually discussed in terms of technological capabilities and their economic consequences. Navigation systems tell you where to drive and Siri gives you quick answers but technologys ability to replace peoples jobs means there are usually some tradeoffs when innovations take hold.
A set of highprofile scholars and authors faced that issue headon Wednesday night at an MIT forum presenting some sharply divergent perspectives about the implications of technology on our selves.
What makes us happy is facing hard challenges and overcoming them said Nicholas Carr the Pulitzernominated author of The Shallows and other books that cast a skeptical light on technologys effects.
By limiting human capacities too quickly too much automation ensures that were going to run into trouble Carr added in one of two central talks at the forum.
But Luciano Floridi a professor at the Oxford University Internet Institute in the events second featured talk offered a more sanguine outlook about the humanmachine relationship.
There is a huge deskilling going on always said Floridi. I wouldnt even know how to start shoeing a horse. Skills come and go.
Instead Floridi suggested there could develop a large social split between those using technology to develop new skills and those not doing so.
The remarks of Carr and Floridi were followed by short commentaries from a trio of MIT professors who have written extensively about the relationship between people and technology.
Sherry Turkle the Abby Rockefeller Mauz Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at MIT warned against what she called the logic of substitution in humanmachine interactions in which machines especially robots become accepted as replacements for facetoface contact.
Consider robots used to help the elderly as Turkle explained. In these cases she said the concept that robots are better than nothing for people can quickly transform into the idea that they are better than anything. 
Yet as Turkle added The point of talking to older people was the compact of generations. Ignoring that she implied means we may be using technology to substitute for our social and ethical obligations to other people.
David Mindell the Frances and David Dibner Professor of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing in STS and a professor of aeronautics and astronautics suggested that advances in technology often challenge our sense of selfdefinition as people. We may define ourselves in terms of seemingly singular abilities only to find that computers can eventually develop those capacities too.
The question Mindell said is how to stay a humanist without being an essentialist if our apparently core qualities are not unique.
For engineers he added a key issue would be to develop designs that are respectful and humancentered rather than aiming for a total replacement of human capacities.
What Nick Carr calls an ethical challenge I would call a design challenge Mindell said.
Carr and Floridi while not sparring directly with one another observed that they do have different personal sensibilities about technologys consequences. Carr quipped that he is a pessimist about technology about four days a week Floridi responded that he himself is an optimist in about the same proportion.
An indestructible teleporting deer is causing chaos in a version of the Grand Theft Auto GTA V game. 
Artist Brent Watanabe has programmed the virtual deer to wander around the large San Andreas game world.
In its first few days of wandering the deer has been caught in a gangland gun battle invaded a military base and been chased by the police.
More than people have tuned in to watch the deer via a video stream on the Twitch site.
The project uses a modified version of GTA V that let Mr Watanabe change the player to look like a deer. The animal wanders around the virtual square miles of the San Andreas world in which the game is set.
The most difficult thing during the creation of the project was simply teaching myself to modify GTA V Mr Watanabe told the BBC. There is an incredibly active modding community and I figured out how to programme the mod through a lot of forum searches and trial and error. 
The biggest difficulty was getting it stable enough to run for hours at a time without crashing he said.
He made the deer impervious to harm so it can keep on wandering despite being regularly shot at beaten up run over by cars and trucks shelled by tanks and falling off buildings.
The trouble it has caused on military bases beaches and on city streets led at one point to it having a four star wanted rating. 
The deer regularly teleports to a new position on the game map so it does not get stuck in one part and to make sure it samples the gamess many different environments and meets lots of its artificial inhabitants.
I was really drawn to the project because of the slapstick but tragic nature of it he said. And then there is an odd draw to simply keep watching to see what the deer is going to do next.
Mr Watanabe said he was surprised and thrilled by the popularity of his creation.
This is the best version of GTA V wrote Adam Smith on the Rock Paper Shotgun game news website. He said he enjoyed the stream for the way the AIcontrolled deer triggered responses from the other computercontrolled elements of the game. 
Hundreds gather for a second night of protests at the spot where a black man was shot dead by police in the US city of Baton Rouge.
This month October nd to be exact marks the year anniversary of the release of Grand Theft Auto III. For most who had played the game around then will remember how truly special and different this game was whether it was the amazing story missions such as Bomb da Base managing to fly the Dodo or just cruising the map listening to the ingame radio which featured Lazlows Chatterbox and great tracks such as Rush Rush.
To mark the occasion Rockstar today announced that the original game will be releasing this Fall most likely on or around October nd on several mobile devices. The current lineup of devices is listed below though more support for other devices are said to be announced later on by the company.
Additionally the company is releasing a limited edition action figure of Claude the games main character. Those who are old school enough will find it interesting that Rockstar is actually mentioning the name of the character as he officially never had a name and this topic was once part of a big debate.
The figure shown above can be bought for from Rockstar Warehouse. Those in limited territories stand the chance to win one as well in a special sweepstakes.

The number of people falling victim to identity theft in the UK has risen by almost a third new figures suggest.
The BBC has learned that criminals are increasingly using internet forums to buy and sell data.
They use the information to open bank accounts obtain credit cards and commit fraud in other peoples names. 
Fraud prevention agency Cifas said the number of victims rose by to in the first three months of compared to the same period in .
Identity theft occurs when criminals abuse the personal data or identity details of an innocent victim to impersonate them or to create a fake identity in order to buy products or services.
One online investigator told BBC News Angus Crawford that criminals are heading to online fraud forums to swap tips as well as buy and sell credit cards passports and email addresses.
Forums will typically sell real credit cards with date of birth detail for as little as he said. 
One of the identities being bought and sold online belongs to an yearold woman.
Barbara Evans and her husband have never even heard of the Swedish fashion retailer Hennes Mauritz HM. But apparently she has an HM account and someone is using it to buy clothes.
Her husband told BBC News that criminals used a stolen passport to open a credit account in her name.
They then changed the delivery address from her home address in Wales to a flat in South East London.
Cifas said that more than of identity theft in the first three months of was attempted or perpetrated online.
The groups research showed that criminals mainly used peoples identities to set up new credit cards and bank accounts these accounted for and of all identity theft cases respectively.
The average age for both male and female identity theft victims was years old.
However Cifas warned that the age group continue to be increasingly targeted with the number of victims in that age bracket up from .
Darren Innes chief executive of due diligence company C Intelligence told BBC News that the crime can be traumatic for victims.
You may still be liable and there have been many cases where people have still had to pay bills even though it has had nothing to do with them in the first place. The mental anguish is quite severe. 
On Tuesday the Metropolitan Police announced that under new legislation officers across the UK can now arrest people who supply specialist printing equipment or materials such as identity card printers printer ribbons embossers and hot foil presses.
The Met said organised criminals use printers costing around to create convincing passports drivers licences and bank cards. 
The genuine versions are produced on higher quality printers under strict controls.
People with false IDs are in jobs they should not be in potentially posing a risk to vulnerable people. They are accessing money they have no right to and living where they ought not be.
Det Supt Snelgrove said the new legislation which was proposed in by the Met in partnership with the specialist printing industry would make life a lot tougher for identity fraudsters.
Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said identity crime was a growing menace that costs people in the UK billions of pounds every year.
The police alongside High Street banks are running a campaign to make customers more aware of the threat of fraud.
Hundreds gather for a second night of protests at the spot where a black man was shot dead by police in the US city of Baton Rouge.
Two weeks ago Max Payne Rockstar Games fansite webmasters were flown in from around the world for a weekend of Max Payne action. Held in Rockstars backyard of southcentral Manhattan this was the largest fansite event that the R team has ever hosted.
Were extremely grateful for the opportunity to check out the game and meet other fansite webmasters. Thanks Rockstar Were psyched for the release of Max Payne .
Weve posted a rundown of our impressions on our new sister site PayneForums.com. It covers our experiences during the event and our impressions of the game specifically system performance gameplay Maxs abilities game visuals multiplayer and our hopes for the future of the game including DLC and online community.
Last weekend Rockstar Games kindly invited illspirit Jevon Andy and I to Los Angeles to experience L.A. Noire firsthand ahead of its release next month. We stayed at the historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel which happens to feature ingame where we met up with various other fan site operators and contest winners. At previous events hosted by Rockstar we played together in a single room but because of the nature of L.A. Noires gameplay we were each given our own console to play individually and at times in groups in our hotel rooms.
The event consisted of a minitour of Los Angeles a Black Dahlia crime bus tour which did a good job of describing the period in which L.A. Noire is set watching fellow webmasters cockblock themselves at the party by the pool and last but not least gametime with L.A. Noire. Speaking of the party there were some rather interesting.. characters to laugh at there such as the guy from Montreal claiming to be a music video producerwearing a white dress jacket and jeanswho we took to calling Canada Vice. But that story is worth an entire chapter by itself
You can read our general thoughts on the game below but as we dont want to give away too much about the game its really something that should be experienced firsthand we have refrained from mentioning specific details concerning case and gameplay elements.
Rockstar Games has just announced that the first L.A. Noire trailer is coming this Thursday November th. The trailer will be shown on the Rockstar News Wire and on an updated version of the L.A. Noire site.
Check out our partner site LANoire.net for a summary of everything we know about the game so far and be sure to join the forum.
In other news Rockstar has said theyll be releasing info on the longawaited L.A. Noire very soon. The game is truly groundbreaking and we will have more information very soon. We may even try to steal a screenshot and sneak it out here on the R News Wire or on Twitter.
This modification created for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV enables us to see what the game would have looked like were it a firstperson shooter.
You can find instructions on how to install the mod on the original YouTube page.
So weve hit that inevitable slownews period after a game is released and the excitement dies down. And since theres not much else to talk about we may as well start speculating on the next GTA which Rockstar has now undoubtedly began working on. Visit our new GTA site GTAV.NET for all the latest news rumours and updates concerning the next GTA. If any solid info arrives youll find it there first.
Today rumours emerged that the game will be set in LA. It began with a slightly bizarre report on VG and was later followed up by an article on Eurogamer which claimed that Rockstar was definitely researching locations around Hollywood. It could like most rumours be a load of bollocks but at least it gives us something to talk about. Register at the GTA forum and post your thoughts.
We can learn a great deal from reported identity theft news and recent identity theft stories. Many of us either dont read about the latest identity theft trends or ignore the identity theft lessons that can be extracted from recent identity theft cases in order to manage identity theft challenges more effectively.
The main reason why its important to pay attention to ID theft news especially the regional and national news is because not only cases of identity theft can negatively affect our personal lives and businesses in many ways but also lessons from identity theft cases and recent fraud trends can be extracted and applied to our lives for preventing identity theft and minimizing the potential damage caused by identity theft.
It is amazing to see so many people and businesses are being affected by identity theft in similar manners over and over again as described in reported identity theft news and stories. How many times have we heard stories about people losing their social security card when in fact they dont really need to carry the card with them every day Or how many times have we read stories about workplace information protection or lack thereof whereby an employee takes an unprotected laptop home to be later stolen along with the millions of customer data stored on the computer 
No one wants to be an identity theft victim but somehow we dont think that identity theft stories reported in the news can happen to us because we think we are doing all the right things. The fact is identity theft threats constantly evolve and we should not rely on a static strategy for identity theft protection because a static strategy for preventing identity theft is doomed to fail at some point as identity theft crime evolves. 
In order to maintain an effective identity protection strategy which addresses recent and known identity theft threats by leveraging the most recent solutions especially when technical and automated tools are introduced to help us be more effective and efficient in our identity protection efforts we must consider reported news about identity theft and recent stories about identity theft. Company risk assessments are typically designed to identify threats and lack of adequate protection against such threats which we can similarly apply to our personal lives to maintain a dynamic identity theft protection strategy. One effective way to identify threats and solutions is to pay attention to recent identity theft stories and news. Current stories about identity theft are great ways to learn about the threats of identity theft consequences and actions taken by companies and people who have faced identity theft cases and their unwanted consequences. Below we have listed news sources for identity theft as well as stories we receive from our readers for your information.
Sony Hack Lessons In light of the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack many companies have realized the importance of all data and unimaginable consequences and impact of a security breach to their survival. Chip and PIN Credit Cards All credit cards will convert from swipeandsign to chip and PIN in the US by October which other major credit card countries have used for years. Fraud Responsibility Depending on the nature of an identity theft case fraud responsibility may take a while to be determined in order to assess who assumes the fraud losses.
There are many ways you can quickly stay on top of the latest news about identity theft. The point of following news about identity theft is not to be overwhelmed by unworthy identity theft stories but rather to learn about the current trends and solutions in the most efficient manner. Links to search engine ID theft news results are posted below for your convenience however Twitter is a great mechanism to quickly deliver and receive worthy news related to identity theft from as many sources as possible. We also analyze some of the ID theft news and deliver the analysis results in our articles and monthly newsletters.

A reader of Cruise Law News sent me this story about two young Italian crew member ages and who seem to have gone on a crime spree while their cruise ship was in port in Palma Majorca.
It turns out that while in port the two men were caught on a security camera stealing a purse a credit card and a computer if I have the translation right.
A news station in Cleveland Ohio aired a consumer investigation segment yesterday about a young couple whose engagement ring was stolen during a recent cruise.
The couple was upset because Carnival refused to replace the ring after it was stolen from the couples cabin and the ring box was found floating in the toilet.
All cruise lines have exclusions and limitations of liability in the passenger tickets which form the contract between the cruise lines and the guests. Passengers are usually out of luck when they lose a personal item due to theft. 
Federal law does not even require cruise lines to report thefts under . The title of the television investigative team video is Marblehead Ohio couple issues warning about cruise ship security after engagement ring stolen.
Our firm is contacted several times a year by passengers who claim that their jewelry was stolen during a cruise. But we never take these type of cases because the courts routinely enforce the cruise lines fine print.
I was surprised to see that the news station included a video of me discussing the issue of cruise ship crime. I was not interviewed by this station. Its old tape of an interview years before.
Even more surprising is that the video of the engagement ring caper ended with the reporter saying that Carnival reimbursed the value of the ring plus and also refunded the cruise for the couple. Why Im not sure. I have never heard of this happening before. But its certainly good public relations to do so. The couple needs to say a big thank you to Carnival and the investigative reporter. It seems only fair for Carnival to get some much needed PR when it does the right thing.

The Sun Sentinel reports that the Broward County Sheriffs Office arrested a Holland American Line HAL crew member for grand theft after he was caught stealing than on a HAL cruise ship.
The newspaper states that the sheriffs office charged Anthonius Novi Hartanto age from Indonesia with eleven counts of grand theft after he stole aboard the HAL Noordam during cruises from Fort Lauderdale last month.
Crew member Hartanto would apparently would take the stolen cash to a location outside the port when the cruise ship would come into port. He would then reportedly wire the stolen money to his bank account in Indonesia.
The articles says that the crew member worked as an auditor and he apparently embezzled the money. 
WPTV West Palm Beach aired an interesting program last night indicating that the cruise industry reports only a small percentage of crimes committed on cruise ships.
Last year the cruise lines reported only crimes on cruise ships. However pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act FOIA request the news station located reports of more than crimes on just cruise ships leaving from Florida ports.
In the cruise lines disclosed only thefts from cruise ships. However WPTVs Dan Krauth stated that a FOIA request uncovered thefts on cruise ship on Floridabased cruise ships alone. Under current U.S. law cruise lines have to report only thefts involving property worth or more. So if of a passengers stuff is stolen the cruise lines keep it secret.
Jewelry computers money and other valuables were stolen essentially on every single cruise leaving Florida last year but only a tiny fraction of the thefts were reported by the cruise lines to the police.
The cruise industry conceals the vast majority of physical assaults sexual assaults and thefts which happen during cruising. It also touts crime statistics based on the incomplete database creating a false and misleading impression of what really happens on the high seas.
WPTV interviewed me during the program. The news station also cited a publication by our firms former law clerk Caitlin Burke explaining that cruise ships evade U.S. law by incorporating in foreign countries and registering their cruise ships in places like the Bahamas. Flags of convenience date all the way back to the s according to Caitlin E. Burke an advocate for cruise victims. Flagging a ship under a foreign flag for the convenience of the cruise line is nothing new nor is it rare Burke wrote in A Qualitative Study of Victimization and Legal Issues Relevant to Cruise Ships.

KATC news station in Louisiana is reporting on the proverbial cruise from hell when a womans fun getaway turned into what she calls a nightmare.
According to the news station the woman and her friend were looking forward to their Carnival cruise to Mexico.
On the second day of her cruise all her money and travel documents birth certificate and drivers license were stolen from her cabin she claims. Watch what unfolds thereafter in the video here.
The passenger claims she was harassed when she complained. Carnival accuses her of harassing the cruise line. By the end of the cruise Carnival considered the matter to be closed. The passenger felt abused.
Whether you are a fan of the Fun Ships or skeptical of cruise passengers when horror stories emerge like this one thing is certain. Cruise passengers have few if any legal rights on the high seas. Hiring a lawyer is a waste of time. All that most passengers can do in a shesaid hesaid dispute is go to the media and let the public decide.
The cruise industry promotes the safety and security of cruising by telling the public that all luggage is carefully xrayed before being loaded onto cruise ships.
Post the concern that terrorists may target cruise ships led to the implementation of the International Ship and Port Facility Security ISPS code which requires that all cruise passenger baggage be subjected to xray machines to check for explosive devices.
It seems that two security officers at the Port of Miami operating the baggage xray machines were not looking for bombs or detonation devices. They were looking for stuff to steal.
According to the Miami New Times and Local NBC Channel two security officers were involved in a scheme to steal electronic equipment from cruise ship passengers luggage and sell the stolen goods on Craigslist.
Jean Russell Thomas age and Sherece Renee Nelson age were arrested in the criminal operation.
Earlier this month a passenger from the Carnival Victorycomplained that that after checking her bags for departure they did not arrive in her cabin. When the bags finally arrived the womans iPad was missing. She notified police.
The defendant is then observed standing up and adjusting an item in which he had placed into his pants rear underneath his shirt and then placing the bag back onto the belt where it would be transferred to the ship.
Thomas later listed two iPads for sale on Craigslist. The iPads matched the description of the missing iPad as well as another iPad reported missing from luggage of another cruise passenger. 
Undercover police officers called Thomas and arranged to buy an iPad. Thomas showed up along with Nelson who acted as a look out according to the newspapers.
Thomaswas arrested for grand theft dealing in stolen goods and this one cracks me up driving with a suspended drivers license habitual.

Yesterday Royal Caribbean and a couple of other cruise lines voluntarily posted a limited amount of data on their websites regarding cruise crimes and disappearances of people from cruise ships.
Of course there was nothing remotely voluntary about the cruise lines conduct.
Last week Senator Rockefeller convened a hearing where he introduced legislation intended to compel under penalty of law all of the CLIA cruise lines to divulge incidents of disappearances from cruise ships and theft homicide and sexual assault on ships. On the day of the hearing the president of Royal Caribbean Adam Goldstein announced that his cruise line as well as Carnival and NCL would agree to post crime data without the necessity of legislation. Cruise executive Goldstein said that his cruise line would begin posting the crime and man overboard information on August st.
The cruise lines have been resisting and dodging disclosing truthful crime statistics over the course of the last Congressional hearings I have attended. Cruise CEO Goldsteins new promises of transparency were made for PR purposes to try and stave off the tough legislation introduced by Senator Rockefeller.
The CEO of the International Cruise Victims organization Ken Carver is also skeptical that the cruise industry can be trusted The AP quoted Mr. Carvers belief that crimes reported by cruise lines are vastly lower than reality because the initial investigations are handled by cruise line security personnel rather than law enforcement officials.
Theskepticism by Senator Rockefeller and cruise victim advocate Carver is well founded. There is a well documented history of the cruise lines providing incomplete and misleading crime data to Congress and the American people. In some instances the information released by the major cruise lines is patently false.
In January the LA Times published an article looking into the problem of crime on cruise ships entitled Cruise Industrys Dark Waters. The article points out that CongressmanShays previously called for Congressional hearings where he requested crime statistics from the cruise industry. The cruise lines resisted the legislation arguing that it can be trusted to provide honest information. At several points in the hearings when cruise line representatives extolled their safety statistics Congressman Shays seemed skeptical. I do not think we have all of the statistics he told representatives of major cruise lines.
Royal Caribbean informed Congressman Shays that sexual assaults occurred over a three year period on its cruise ships. However in a case we handled against Royal Caribbean involving yearold twins who alleged that a crew member molested them the cruise line was forced to hand over the internal records requested by our firm after a judge threatened to fine it a day if it failed to comply.
The Royal Caribbean data revealed not just incidents but reports from passengers who said they were victims of sexual assault sexual battery sexual harassment and inappropriate touching during a shorter time period. The LA Times quoted me saying that Royal Caribbean redefined things and in the process magically poof what used to be a crime no longer existed. Then they served up these numbers and thought they could get away with it.
So with this history in mind lets take a look at what Royal Caribbean just posted yesterday as part of its voluntary disclosure on its website.
It disclosed just three persons overboard for the time period beginning October through the end of June . There is no information regarding these incidents on the cruise lines skimpy website chart. There is no way a consumer can understand what happened. One of the three incidents involved a young woman who went overboard in September . You can read about in detail on our website here here and here.
May Crew member disappeared from the Millennium see cruise expert Professor Ross Kleins database
Royal Caribbeans website indicates that the cruise line intends to reveal only those overboard situations involving U.S. citizens. But there is no reason to hide man overboard incidents involving passengers of other nationalities and crew members. Disney Cruise Line for example discloses overboard cases involving nonU.S. citizens.
The truth is that at least people went overboard for the time period in question. But Royal Caribbean disclosed only incidents. Thats only around of the true number. If a cruise ship is a floating city why exclude all of the crew members and nonU.S. citizens who are members of the city Royal Caribbean includes crew members and nonU.S. passengers as part of its population in determining crime ratios but then excludes crew members and non U.S. citizens when they are victims. That manipulation of the data distorts the true crime ratios.
The only explanation for doing this is that the cruise line wants to present an image that is markedly different from the truth.
Royal Caribbeans voluntary disclosure reveals exactly why the cruise industry cannot be trusted. Senator Rockefeller like Congressman Shays long ago has every reason not to believe the cruise lines voluntary statistics.
The American people and citizens of countries around the world deserve to know the truth about crime and overboard cruise passengers and crew members. Cruise lines like Royal Caribbean like to keep the public in the dark.
A well drafted law with stiff penalties is the only way to shed light on what really happens on cruise ships far out at sea.
Anewspaper in the Bahamas published an article Cruise Ships Warn on Crime explaining that cruise executives from Miami met with Bahamian officials about the increasing crime levels in Nassau which are no longer safe for passengers. We have written several articles about the crime problem in Nassau including the rape of young women who go into the bars near the port petty theft snatch and grab robberies and violent crime.
Passengers are being warned to stay on the cruise ships when the ship calls on Nassau. Crew members have known this for years.
Newspapers today are reporting that a U.S. citizen was shot and killed when he tried to stop the robbery of another U.S. tourist visiting Nassau. The U.K. Daily Mail reports thatAmerican Kyle Bruner was murdered in the Bahamas over the weekend while attempting to help a tourist who was being mugged.
The U.S. Department of State characterizes the crime level on New Providence Island where Nassau is located as critical. Snatchandgrab crimes are common occurrences in Nassau. The U.S. State Department says it has received reports of assaults including sexual assaults in casinos outside hotels and on cruise ships.
I have represented many women sexually assaulted in Nassau and on cruise ships in that port and many passengers robbed at gunpoint.

I have never written an article telling cruise passengers to avoid a port of call. I usually report on what I know and then leave it up to the passengers to decide what to so. But Nassau is flat out dangerous. In my opinion if you knew what the cruise lines know youd be crazy to take your family there.

Most Chinese ship employees on Celebrity cruise ships are employed in the laundry department earning only around a month.
Its good to see a local sheriffs office involved in responding to cruise ship theft like this. Under federal law cruise lines are not even required to report a theft of under . The FBI will not even respond to reports of cruise ship thefts of under . Unless a local law enforcement entity gets involved crew members can steal from passengers and other crew members and know that the worst that will happen is they may be fired and sent home. 
The Eclipse was last in the news when passengers were held up at gun point in St. Luciaten days ago. 
The Royal Gazette newspaper in Bermuda reports today that a passenger from the NCL Norwegian Star was arrested as he tried to disembark the cruise ship with a painting described as the size of a door.
The year old passenger from Kentucky admitted that he stole the painting from the NCL cruise ship once it docked in Bermuda. The newspaper states that the painting was an official copy of a Rembrandt painting valued at .. 
When the NCL cruise ship staff confronted him the brazen thief claimed Im going to mail it home.
He then gave various excuses regarding how he obtained the painting claiming that he bought it at auction painted it himself and won it in a raffle.
One thing that the passenger didnt realize is that NCL cruise ships have the most CCTV surveillance cameras in the cruise industry. The newspaper states that the ships video footage showed him removing the painting from the wall and carrying it towards his cabin.
His public defender told the Magistrate that he was a recovering drug addict and the medication he was on to treat opiate withdrawal caused him to act oddly. 
The Judge went light on the recoveringdrugaddictturnedcruiseartconnoisseur and fined him .
Bermuda Senior MagistrateArchibald Warner was again busy fining cruise tourists last week.
According to the Bermuda Sun Magistrate Warner fined a Norwegian Star passenger on his honeymoon after the local police used a sniffer canine to locate a few marijuana cigarettes grams in the passengers cabin while he and his newlywed bride were enjoying the sites ashore.
I have written a dozen articles heres oneand heres anotherabout the good Judge Warner fining U.S. passengers big bucks for small amounts of pot. It seems like these fines are a major source of revenue for Bermuda. The fact that the pot is found only after police take dogs on the cruise ships to conduct searches of private cabins with no warrant or probable cause doesnt seem to mind the prosecution or the judiciary in Bermuda.
American passengers who are already kicked off the cruise ship and facing jail time are always quick to pay to to avoid a few months in the slammer on the rocky island. What a racket. The newspapers in Bermuda love covering these type of cases and are sure to plaster a photo of the busted pothead in their newspapers.
And speaking of rackets Magistrate Warner also fined a Royal Caribbean cruise passenger after he was caught stealing stuff on the Explorer of the Seas cruise ship. According to Bernews the Royal Caribbean security caught a passenger from New Jersey using a stolen credit card in three transactions to dishonestly acquire goods and services from the ship spa including two bottles of mens cologne.
Now I dont like crooks and Im glad that the bad guy with the cologne got caught. But I wonder how on earth a judge in Bermuda could assert jurisdiction over a theft committed by a U.S. citizen on a foreign flagged cruise ship in international waters
Bermuda the Bahamas whatever. Both start with a B close enough for Magistrate Warner. The short hearing netted Bermuda quick money for a case that it has no jurisdiction over. 
This would be amusing I suppose except for the fact that Bermuda demonstrates no interest in prosecuting serious cruise ship crimes. Bermuda looks the other way when faced with rapes abandonment of mariners at sea or mysterious disappearances of crew membersthat occur on cruise ships which are in fact flying the maritime flag of Bermuda.

LONDON Reuters The SWIFT secure messaging service which banks use to transfer money around the world outlined on Friday areas in which it hopes to improve security following attacks in which hackers stole millions of dollars from banks in Bangladesh and Ecuador.
SWIFT said on Friday it would consult its users which are also its owners about new measures including the potential to develop new tools that could allow it to spot fraudulent payment instructions.
Historically the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications SWIFT core business has focused on simply passing authenticated messages between banks.
In future it may seek to check inside the messages to ensure payment instructions are consistent with customers normal account patterns akin to the checks retail banks conduct to spot unusual credit card transactions.
The Belgiumbased cooperative has been the backbone of international finance for four decades and revelations in recent months that several banks have suffered attacks on their SWIFT terminals has hit confidence in a service previously seen as totally secure.
In February thieves hacked into the SWIFT system of the Bangladesh central bank sending messages to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York allowing them to steal million.
The attack followed a theft from Banco del Austro in Ecuador that netted thieves over million and a previously undisclosed attack on Vietnams Tien Phong Bank that was not successful.
On Friday European Banking Authority Chairman Andrea Enria urged authorities in European Union member states to stresstest their financial institutions for cyber risks warning banks might be required to hold extra capital as a buffer against what is an emerging threat.
SWIFT said it will also look into requiring customers to use existing security measures such as twofactor authentication of payment instructions which are currently optional on the system.
The group will also look at developing new audit frameworks such that larger banks offering correspondent banking services can confirm that their clients often in developing countries have appropriate security measures in place around their SWIFT terminal.
SWIFT said it would seek to encourage banks which have hitherto been reluctant to inform others when they are attacked to share information so that trends and tactics in cyber criminal behavior can be identified and tackled.
The cooperative may also devise new systems for cancelling payment instructions. Currently cancellation messages can only be sent between users which have a direct banking relationship. This makes it harder to cancel a fraudulent instruction sent via intermediary banks.

Support services for victims of identity fraud are struggling to keep up with demand as the number of Australians scammed online skyrockets.
It is estimated more than million Australians have their identity stolen each year at a cost of about billion.
Operating out of a demountable building on the University of the Sunshine Coast campus is IDCARE the only free helpline for Australian and New Zealand victims of identity fraud.
IDCARE is made up of about staff some of them volunteers and it is funded by contributions from industry and the Federal Government.
Managing director Dr David Lacey who spent years at the Department of Defence and the Australian Crime Commission said the number of calls has been doubling every three months.
If were at cyber war theres a lot of investment going into bullets and rifles at the moment but in terms of the stretcher bearers and the first aid post and those to provide the triage and the emergency support were it he said.

When Mr McDonald reported the theft at his local police station he was told to contact the Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network ACORN.
All he got back from ACORN was an email with a tracking number confirming his case.

Although consumer identity theft gets a great deal of attention and for good reason since an attack can hurt a persons credit for years individuals arent the only ones in the crosshairs of identity thieves. Businesses are being targeted as well.
According to the Identity Theft Protection Association business identity theft is separate from the kinds of informationsecurity breaches that have been in the news lately where confidential customer information is stolen.
A thief might act as a representative of the company in order to defraud creditors and suppliers loan officers unsuspecting customers and even the government if taxes are involved. The results could be a drained company bank account unexpected lines of credit misdirected customer payments and unauthorized equipment purchases.
Many companies tend to purchase security devices or software but then take a set it and forget it mentality that pushes the issue to the back burner says Eric Knight CEO of the Phoenixbased technology firm SimpleWan. A standalone device purchased only a year ago that hasnt been updated or monitored may already be breached and you wouldnt even know it.
Just as consumers are encouraged to look at their bank activity frequently even checking daily online to catch any fraudulent charges businesses should review transactions regularly. If a company has a longstanding relationship with a bank its worth having a conversation with bank officials to let them know that there are no plans to open new lines of credit or loan accounts.
If a company uses wire transfers and electronic payments its wise to implement a system that requires at least two people to approve each transfer. Some financial institutions also offer other forms of authentication that must be provided before a transfer is approved.
This type of scam relies on an authoritative tone over email or the phone that tricks people into divulging confidential information such as company account numbers or passwords. Phishing scams often purport to be from government agencies or legitimate financial institutions even though none of those entities would ever ask a business owner to divulge such information by phone or over email.
Create invoicing standards with customers and ask them to check with you if there are any changes. For example you may regularly email invoices and accept electronic payments. If a customer gets a mailed invoice with a request that a check or money order be sent to a location thats different from the company address that should be a red flag.
By monitoring accounts frequently and being more aware of potential threats a business can reduce the chances that identity thieves will do longterm damage.

The taking element in a theft typically requires seizing possession of property that belongs to another and may also involve removing or attempting to remove the property. However it is the element of intent where most of the complex legal challenges typically arise in theftrelated cases.
For example Alexgoes to Patrickscomputerstore puts two flash drivesin his pocket and walks out the door intent of keeping them. Alex can be charged with theft. Had Alex stolen Patrcks car from the parking lot Alex would likely be charged with grand theft.
The taking element in a theft typically requires seizing possession of property that belongs to another and may also involve removing or attempting to remove the property. However it is the element of intent where most of the complex legal challenges typically arise in theftrelated cases. In order for a theft to be proven it often must be shown that the accused acted with the specific intent to take someone elses property and to keep it or otherwise convert it. Some of the most common defenses in theft cases reflect this challenge as a defendant may claim that they thought certain property was theirs or that they were just borrowing it.
Petty or petit thefts typically occur when someone steals property below a certain value specified by law. The amount at which a theft is classified petty varies depending on the jurisdiction but a couple of examples would be property worth less than or . Petty thefts are usually categorized as relatively minor crimes also known as misdemeanors.
Grand theft on the other hand occurs when property is stolen that is worth more than the limit for petty theft. Typically the market value for the property at the time it is stolen is used to determine that propertys value for purposes of petty or theft charges. Grand theft or comparable violations such as grand larceny are classified as felonies in all states. This is the most serious category of offenses and can have severe consequences for individuals convicted of such crimes.
Jurisdictions may create additional classes or categories of theft to address a particularly troublesome types of theft. Probably the most wellknown example is grand theft auto which of course refers to stealing a car. Typically these more narrowlycategorized types of theft receive harsher punishments than standard comparable theftcrimes.

The commission is asking a federal court to order Lifelock to make refunds to customers affected by the alleged violations.
It is essential that companies live up to their obligations under orders obtained by the FTC said Jessica Rich Director of the FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection. If a company continues with practices that violate orders and harm consumers we will act.
The settlement stemmed from previous FTC allegations that LifeLock used false claims to promote its identity theft protection services.

Michael Peters a former chief information security officer for the identitytheft security firm LifeLock is suing the company under whistleblowerprotection statutes claiming he was unjustly fired for objecting after the company deliberately turned off or reduced the number of alerts it sent to customers in order to reduce the number of calls to its customer support center.
Courthouse News Service broke the story on March noting also that according to its own arc.

Ads touting Lifelocks identity protection program are ubiquitous on the Internet and elsewhere. Theyre the ones in which the companys CEO Todd Davis brandishes his Social Security number in an open dare to identity thieves.
The company provides a million guarantee to its subscribers covering out of pocket costs resulting from fraud or identity theft. It even takes over the process of dealing with banks and creditors to help consumers restore their credit in the event of fraud the ads say.
According to two consumer class action suits its just that. The suits charge that the guarantee is riddled with fine print and loopholes.
In one of the cases Phoenixarea resident Byrl Lane and his attorneys argue that LifeLock also based in Arizona misleads its customers because the million service guarantee it advertises is riddled with restrictions waivers and limitations.
The Arizona Department of Insurance has reviewed LifeLocks service and does not believe it is an insurance product department spokeswoman Erin Klug told the Arizona Republic.
Oddly enough the company also faces a legal challenge from Experian one of the three big credit reporting agencies. Experians suit claims that LifeLock is misusing the fraud alert system laid out in the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA.
LifeLock which claims to be the leading identity theft prevention firm places fraud alerts on its subscribers credit files at Experian Equifax and Trans Union. It also attempts to remove subscribers from junk mailing lists and provides a variety of other services.
Although they differ in the details all three of the lawsuits basically allege the LifeLock makes false claims and does not protect the degree of protection it promises.
The company says it has more than subscribers. Using federal statistics this should mean that more than of its subscribers have been victims of identity theft.
But Davis says that so far only of its customers have had to invoke the guarantee and that none of them have complained about the services offered.
Coming to the defense of LifeLock is ACCESS American Consumer Credit Education Support Services a notforprofit organization that deals with privacy and identity theft prevention.
It is ACCESS position that any attempt to put a company out of business which has proven itself to be effective against fraud and identity theft would be a disservice to the public. LifeLock is certainly such a company the organization said in a news release.
ConsumerAffairs.com has not received any complaints from LifeLock customers and a Web search of other consumer sites also failed to turn up any substantive complaints.
The safeguards that LifeLock promises are largely the result of a law that requires the three big credit reporting companies to provide consumers with certain protections. Consumers dont really need LifeLock to take advantage of the laws protections but Davis thinks that at a month its more costefficient to let his company do it.
Among other things the law provides that the credit reporting agencies must send an annual credit report to any consumer who asks for one. They must also offer fraud alerts and other protections that LifeLock promises.

Almost million consumers have signed up for LifeLock which promises to protect their credit and identity. But in the midst of three lawsuits against the company consumer advocates say LifeLock customers are wasting their money while the companys founder insists it is the best way for consumers to protect themselves.
LifeLocks cofounder and chief executive officer Todd Davis is so confident in the product that he shares his own Social Security number in the companys many TV radio and print ads.
But consumer advocates and two class action lawsuits claim that LifeLock actually provides very little protection. LifeLock based in Tempe Arizona works by renewing an individuals fraud alert with one of the nations three large credit bureaus a service which federal laws mandate any individual can do for free usually within a few minutes over the phone or Internet.
What the fraud alert does is it basically puts a red flag on your credit report and it tells any potential creditor that if they receive an application for credit they should take additional measures to determine that the person is the person that theyre claiming to be. Typically that would be a phone call said Paul Stephens director of public policy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization.
Fraud alerts last days and then must be renewed. LifeLock charges a month to make sure its customers fraud alerts never expire a service most consumer advocates are baffled anyone would pay money for.
No one needs to pay a third party firm to assert their federal rights Ed Mierzwinski consumer program director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization wrote in an email. And for one hundred bucks plus each year it is certainly not cheap to do so.
I like to think of LifeLock as being a concierge service Stephens said Are you the kind of person who would pay somebody for example to do your shopping for you
I would point out that to do the sorts of things that LifeLock does for you you dont even need to leave your house Stephens continued. You can get on the phone or get on your computer and do it in a couple of minutes. So I dont really see that they bring a lot of value to the consumer.
Davis didnt argue the concierge analogy in a phone interview with ConsumerAffairs.com but said the company offers much more than the renewal service.
Were also doing other things like scouring the Internet looking for your personal information being bought or sold on the black market Davis said. Were authenticating when someone puts in a change of address to confirm its you.
In advertisements the company also promises to stop junk mail including preapproved credit offers and provide a credit report services that again a consumer can do for free over the phone or Internet.
LifeLocks million guarantee is our intent to go support any member of LifeLock who might become a victim of identity theft while subscribed to our service so we that can go out and fill our intent to do everything the law allows us to do to help that person recover their good name Davis said. So whether thats hiring third person personnel whether thats covering any losses or expenses whether its getting accounts closed and getting new ones issued thats what well do.
But two pending class action lawsuits claim that the companys million guarantee is not a guarantee at all but just a promise that the company is not actually obligated to fulfill.
There is no million guarantee said Leonard Aragon one of the attorneys who filed a class action lawsuit against the company. If you look at the terms of the contract it very clearly says we wont pay consequential damages. We wont pay you directly so theres really no way to get up into the million dollars.
Our understanding is that it basically covers any defect in their product said Aragon of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro in Seattle. What that means is the failure to place the fraud alert or maybe they accidentally spell your name wrong.
Davis said the reason LifeLock does not make any actual guarantees is because he doesnt want it to become an insurance company.
Insurance by design is not built to mitigate risk. Davis said. They spread actuarial risk over a group of people. LifeLock is so dramatically more than that. We want to be the most comprehensive solution out there to actually prevent this crime to mitigate the risk on the front end. We dont want to limit what we can do for consumers. We dont want to limit where they can acquire this protection by only going through licensed insurance agents. We want you to be able to go get this at Office Depot or CVS Pharmacy or through AAA.
Of LifeLocks customers have filed claims against the companys million guarantee and all have been pleased with the results Davis said.
But Aragon warned that although the company is fulfilling its promise now if there is ever a serious data breach and many of its customers are defrauded the company may not fulfill its promise. He compared it to the insurance companies who failed to honor their flood clause for consumers whose homes were destroyed in New Orleans from a breached levy rather than flood waters.
When everyones all happy and it really isnt that big of a deal and there really arent that many claims well insurance companies say sure well pay that. We dont want to cause trouble because we want people to come to our insurance company. But when it hits the fan and there are a lot of claims well thats when we start going into the contracts Aragon said.
You cant promise one thing and have your contract say one thing because eventually thats going to come around and its going to be bad news for the consumers who thought they were buying protection when in actuality they werent buying anything Aragon said. They were buying some good customer service. Big deal.
Davis said no matter what the company will honor its promise and that its terms are only written that way to avoid becoming an insurance company and thus subject to regulation in each state where it does business.
If we didnt honor our guarantee it would be catastrophic for the company Davis said. It wouldnt behoove us in the business were in when our sole purpose is protecting consumers and taking care of consumers if we elected to say we choose not to keep our promises then its going to be catastrophic to the company.
Despite the language of the million guarantee Aragon and consumer advocates say LifeLock is no guarantee to ward off fraud or identity theft.
Theyre telling everyone this is LifeLock so were going lock your credit and were going to protect you from identity theft when the reality is all they do is put a fraud alert and all that does is protect you from having instant credit taken out under your Social Security number Aragon said.
Lets say you get your wallet stolen and your checkbook stolen and someone goes to a checks cashed store. It does nothing to protect against that. Aragon continued. It also does nothing to protect against your credit card being stolen.
Fraud alerts do not stop the issuance of credit Mierzwinski wrote. They do condition the issuance of credit by making the creditor liable if the consumer can prove damages but they dont stop it.
Davis said if a LifeLock customer is defrauded in any way even outside the limited protection of a fraud alert the customer can invoke the million guarantee and the company will honor it.
The third case against the company was filed by Experian one of the credit bureaus LifeLock uses to issue its customers fraud alerts.
Experian contends that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act only an individual consumer or an individual acting on behalf of the consumer can place fraud alerts.
The spirit of the laws are very clear to us to be there to protect consumers and we feel very strongly that were doing exactly in the spirit of the laws intent which is helping consumers take advantage of those protections offered by those laws Davis said.
If Experian wins its case it could be the end of LifeLock and its many clones. But Davis said he believes the company will continue to protect consumers if that happens.
If all of a sudden they took away those protections from those consumers were still going to have the most comprehensive service He said. Were still going to do things to mitigate the risk.
I dont recommend Lifelock but I dont want Experian winning case law that makes it harder for consumers to use third parties to help assert their rights which I guess could be a result if Experian prevails Mierzwinski wrote.
Despite the companys recent legal troubles LifeLock has continued to expand its customer base and part of that could be the result of a questionable affiliate reseller program.
A search for LifeLock on any search engine yields thousands of results many of which are supposed independent review blog or news Web sites that unanimously give glowing reviews of LifeLock in juxtaposition with its competitors. Almost every page of these websites are followed by enthusiastic user comments from consumers who cant wait to buy LifeLock and links to purchase it.
One website CredibleReviews.Com retells the identity theft story of one of LifeLocks paid endorsers followed by links on where to purchase LifeLock.
While none of the sites ConsumerAffairs.com queried returned our phone calls or emails Davis said he doesnt believe they are owned by LifeLock and assumed they are the result of an affiliate program in which anyone can resell LifeLock and make a percent commission.
Although his picture is on the LifeLock affiliate website Davis said he knows little about the program and said he thinks there may be some disclaimer to try and prevent that sort of misleading sales behavior.
Despite its critics consumers seem to be pleased with Lifelocks product. ConsumerAffairs.com has received only one complaint and the Better Business Bureau has processed in the past months.
Consumers who wish to opt out of credit offers can do so by calling the Consumer Credit Reporting Industry at or by visiting its website.
Almost million consumers have signed up for LifeLock which promises to protect their credit and identity. But in the midst of three lawsuits against the company consumer advocates say LifeLock customers are wasting their money while the companys founder insists it is the best way for consumers to protect themselves.
LifeLocks cofounder and chief executive officer Todd Davis is so confident in the product that he shares his own Social Security number in the .
A West Virginia law firm has filed its third class action lawsuit against Lifelock whose ubiquitous ads promise ironclad protection against identity theft. Earlier suits were filed in New Jersey and Maryland.
The lawsuits filed by Marks Klein LLP allege that LifeLock and its multimilliondollar advertising campaign provided false and misleading information about the limited level of identity protection the company provides and failed to warn them about the potential adverse impact the companys services could have on their credit profiles.
The complaints also allege that the firms CEO Richard Todd Davis has himself been a victim of identity theft by multiple offenders while a customer of LifeLocks services.
Davis publishes his Social Security number in the Lifelock ads as a demonstration of his supposed confidence in the companys practices.
Attorney David Paris maintains that LifeLock dramatically overstates the level of protection provided by its primary service the placement and constant renewal of fraud alerts on its subscribers credit profiles.
Customers of LifeLock rely on the companys misleading advertisements and pay for a perceived level of protection that is clearly not provided said Paris.
LifeLock which is headquartered in Tempe Ariz. charges subscribers per month. According to the complaints potential LifeLock subscribers are enticed by the safety net of what appears to be a million insurance policy against any losses sustained as a result of identity theft.
In actuality once you get beyond the numerous legal limitations and disclaimers the policy really only guarantees that LifeLock will investigate how to fix its failure if an incident occurs and will pay other thirdparty organizations to attempt to restore the subscribers identity noted David Grubb of the Grubb Law Group in Charleston W. Va. who is representing West Virginia class plaintiffs.
The subscriber receives no monetary recompense and no guarantee that their reputation and credit status will be restored he said.
According to the complaints LifeLock induces consumers into subscribing through a marketing campaign that showcases CEO Davis broadcasting his own Social Security number as testimony to his confidence in Lifelocks services.
As a result the complaints allege Daviss identity has been stolen while he was a customer and is upon information and belief presently being misappropriated by at least twenty identity thieves.
The West Virginia action seeks to recover the money subscribers have paid to LifeLock and to prohibit the company from continuing to promote its services through a deceptive marketing campaign. Marks Klein said it plans to file similar actions on behalf of consumers in other states.
Founded in LifeLock presently has approximately million subscribers across the United States.
Beyond the charges leveled in the complaints lead counsel Paris related the story of a Wisconsin consumer who contacted the firm regarding her accidental experience with LifeLock.
Her debit card was stolen and the thief had the audacity to use the card to buy a subscription to LifeLock he noted. Most disturbingly LifeLock issued the subscription to the thief in the thiefs name clearly failing to verify the appropriate information.
Consumer advocates say that the service provided by Lifelock is little more than a concierge offering something that consumers could do themselves for free.

But two pending class action lawsuits claim that the companys million guarantee is not a guarantee at all but just a promise that the company is not actually obligated to fulfill.
There is no million guarantee said Leonard Aragon one of the attorneys who filed a class action lawsuit against the company. If you look at the terms of the contract it very clearly says we wont pay consequential damages. We wont pay you directly so theres really no way to get up into the million dollars.
Our understanding is that it basically covers any defect in their product said Aragon of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro in Seattle. What that means is the failure to place the fraud alert or maybe they accidentally spell your name wrong.
Davis said the reason LifeLock does not make any actual guarantees is because he doesnt want it to become an insurance company.
Insurance by design is not built to mitigate risk. Davis said. They spread actuarial risk over a group of people. LifeLock is so dramatically more than that. We want to be the most comprehensive solution out there to actually prevent this crime to mitigate the risk on the front end. We dont want to limit what we can do for consumers. We dont want to limit where they can acquire this protection by only going through licensed insurance agents. We want you to be able to go get this at Office Depot or CVS Pharmacy or through AAA.
Of LifeLocks customers have filed claims against the companys million guarantee and all have been pleased with the results Davis said.
But Aragon warned that although the company is fulfilling its promise now if there is ever a serious data breach and many of its customers are defrauded the company may not fulfill its promise. He compared it to the insurance companies who failed to honor their flood clause for consumers whose homes were destroyed in New Orleans from a breached levy rather than flood waters.
When everyones all happy and it really isnt that big of a deal and there really arent that many claims well insurance companies say sure well pay that. We dont want to cause trouble because we want people to come to our insurance company. But when it hits the fan and there are a lot of claims well thats when we start going into the contracts Aragon said.
You cant promise one thing and have your contract say one thing because eventually thats going to come around and its going to be bad news for the consumers who thought they were buying protection when in actuality they werent buying anything Aragon said. They were buying some good customer service. Big deal.
Davis said no matter what the company will honor its promise and that its terms are only written that way to avoid becoming an insurance company and thus subject to regulation in each state where it does business.
If we didnt honor our guarantee it would be catastrophic for the company Davis said. It wouldnt behoove us in the business were in when our sole purpose is protecting consumers and taking care of consumers if we elected to say we choose not to keep our promises then its going to be catastrophic to the company.
Despite the language of the million guarantee Aragon and consumer advocates say LifeLock is no guarantee to ward off fraud or identity theft.
Theyre telling everyone this is LifeLock so were going lock your credit and were going to protect you from identity theft when the reality is all they do is put a fraud alert and all that does is protect you from having instant credit taken out under your Social Security number Aragon said.
Lets say you get your wallet stolen and your checkbook stolen and someone goes to a checks cashed store. It does nothing to protect against that. Aragon continued. It also does nothing to protect against your credit card being stolen.
Fraud alerts do not stop the issuance of credit Mierzwinski wrote. They do condition the issuance of credit by making the creditor liable if the consumer can prove damages but they dont stop it.
Davis said if a LifeLock customer is defrauded in any way even outside the limited protection of a fraud alert the customer can invoke the million guarantee and the company will honor it.
Consumers who wish to opt out of credit offers can do so by calling the Consumer Credit Reporting Industry at or by visiting its website.
A West Virginia law firm has filed its third class action lawsuit against Lifelock whose ubiquitous ads promise ironclad protection against identity theft. Earlier suits were filed in New Jersey and Maryland.
The lawsuits filed by Marks Klein LLP allege that LifeLock and its multimilliondollar advertising campaign provided false and misleading information about the limited level of identity protection the company provides and failed to warn them about the pot.
Mark Huffman has been a consumer news reporter for ConsumerAffairs .
accounts in consumers names. Some ads even included LifeLock CEO Todd Davis social security number in an effort to demonstrate Davis confidence in the
against certain forms of identity theft and gave them no protection against the
from a potential creditor before a new account was opened. The FTC charged that
identity theft to consumers including whether a particular consumer has become
services can protect against or eliminate the risk of identity theft or that it
LifeLock Inc. has agreed to pay million to the Federal Trade Commission and million to a group of state attorneys general to settle charges that the company used false claims to promote its identity theft protection services which it widely advertised by displaying the CEOs Social Security number on the side of a truck.
In one of the largest FTCstate coordinated settlements on record LifeLock and its principals will be barred from making deceptive claims and required to take more stringent measures to safeguard the personal information they collect from customers.
While LifeLock promised consumers complete protection against all types of identity theft in truth the protection it actually provided left enough holes that you could drive a truck through it said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz.
This agreement effectively prevents LifeLock from misrepresenting that its services offer absolute prevention against identity theft because there is unfortunately no foolproof way to avoid ID theft Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said. Consumers can take definitive steps to minimize the chances of having their personal information stolen and this settlement will help them make more informed decisions about whether to enroll in ID theft protection services.
Since LifeLocks ads have claimed that it could prevent identity theft for consumers willing to sign up for its amonth service.
The FTCs complaint charged that the fraud alerts that LifeLock placed on customers credit files protected only against certain forms of identity theft and gave them no protection against the misuse of existing accounts the most common type of identity theft. It also allegedly provided no protection against medical identity theft or employment identity theft in which thieves use personal information to get medical care or apply for jobs.
Even for types of identity theft for which fraud alerts are most effective LifeLock does not provide absolute protection. They alert creditors opening new accounts to take reasonable measures to verify that the individual applying for credit actually is who he or she claims to be but in some instances identity thieves can thwart even reasonable precautions.
New account fraud the type of identity theft for which fraud alerts are most effective comprised only percent of identity theft incidents according to an FTC survey released in .
The FTCs complaint further alleged that LifeLock also claimed that it would prevent unauthorized changes to customers address information that it constantly monitored activity on customer credit reports and that it would ensure that a customer always would receive a telephone call from a potential creditor before a new account was opened. The FTC charged that those claims were false.
LifeLock sold Californians a false sense of security against identity theft with advertisements that were chock full of inflated claims and promises California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. Brown said. Todays settlement prevents the company from misrepresenting and overstating its services and reimburses LifeLock subscribers who were misled.
The Attorneys General of Alaska Arizona California Delaware Florida Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kentucky Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Missouri Mississippi Montana Nebraska Nevada New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oregon Pennsylvania South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Vermont Virginia Washington and West Virginia participated in the settlement.
LifeLock has been the target of consumer complaints class action lawsuits and criticism from consumer and privacy activists for years.
LifeLocks cofounder and chief executive officer Todd Davis is so confident in the product that he shares his own Social Security number in the companys many TV radio and print ads.
But consumer advocates and two class action lawsuits claim that LifeLock actually provides very little protection. LifeLock based in Tempe Arizona works by renewing an individuals fraud alert with one of the nations three large credit bureaus a service which federal laws mandate any individual can do for free usually within a few minutes over the phone or Internet.
What the fraud alert does is it basically puts a red flag on your credit report and it tells any potential creditor that if they receive an application for credit they should take additional measures to determine that the person is the person that theyre claiming to be. Typically that would be a phone call said Paul Stephens director of public policy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization.
Fraud alerts last days and then must be renewed. LifeLock charges a month to make sure its customers fraud alerts never expire a service most consumer advocates are baffled anyone would pay money for.
No one needs to pay a third party firm to assert their federal rights Ed Mierzwinski consumer program director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization wrote in an email. And for one hundred bucks plus each year it is certainly not cheap to do so.
I like to think of LifeLock as being a concierge service Stephens said Are you the kind of person who would pay somebody for example to do your shopping for you
I would point out that to do the sorts of things that LifeLock does for you you dont even need to leave your house Stephens continued. You can get on the phone or get on your computer and do it in a couple of minutes. So I dont really see that they bring a lot of value to the consumer.
Davis didnt argue the concierge analogy in a phone interview with ConsumerAffairs.com but said the company offers much more than the renewal service.
Were also doing other things like scouring the Internet looking for your personal information being bought or sold on the black market Davis said. Were authenticating when someone puts in a change of address to confirm its you.
In advertisements the company also promises to stop junk mail including preapproved credit offers and provide a credit report services that again a consumer can do for free over the phone or Internet.
LifeLocks million guarantee is our intent to go support any member of LifeLock who might become a victim of identity theft while subscribed to our service so we that can go out and fill our intent to do everything the law allows us to do to help that person recover their good name Davis said. So whether thats hiring third person personnel whether thats covering any losses or expenses whether its getting accounts closed and getting new ones issued thats what well do.

WTNH Identity thieves arent just targeting adults. Even if your kids are not yet old enough to swipe a credit card it is important to check to see if they have a credit report. They can be the victims of identity theft too.
Thieves often want to target kids because they know they can get away with it for a lot longer. Typically kids will not find out something is wrong with their credit until they grow up and are not able to get a credit card or apply for a loan. However at that point its too late their credit has already been destroyed.
Child identity theft happens more often than you might think. The Federal Trade Commission says of the more than identity theft complaints made last year about were for people age and younger.
How do thieves get a hold of a childs social security number in the first place If its on school forms and paperwork it can get into the wrong hands. Ask if the school really needs it when filling out forms. Also family members who know a childs social security number might use it for the wrong reasons. Kids social security numbers can be stolen in a data breach along with adults information. Its also a good idea to remind your kids not to give out any personal information online since this can be an opportunity for thieves to steal it.
If your child starts getting preapproved credit offers in the mail or calls from debt collectors those are red flags that his or her identity may have been stolen. If that happens contact the three major credit reporting agencies Equifax Experian and TransUnion and ask to check if your child has a credit report. Most kids should not have one. A credit report may indicate fraud. If your childs identity has been compromised you will need to work with the credit reporting agencies and contact the creditors to fix the problem.
Whether or not you suspect fraud its a good idea to check your childs credit by the time he or she is years old.

A new mobile app from identity theft protection company IDShield was released on Monday June and aims to help consumers by putting information and control in their hands when it comes to safeguarding against identity theft threats.
IDShield said its allnew app will feature uptodate and comprehensive identity monitoring information as well as access to a private investigator if issues do arise for a user.
The sooner you become aware of a potential or legitimate identity theft the better chance you have of fixing it before it can cause damage Jeff Bell CEO of LegalShield IDShields parent company said in a press release. Thats the advantage of IDShields new app. Were giving our members realtime information and immediate access with the touch of a button to the industrys only dedicated team of licensed private investigators.
The IDShield app will feature emergency call service for members customized alerts and fullservice identity monitoring.
Consumers often think monitoring their credit is enough but while thieves would like to take your money they really want your identity to steal other peoples money Bell added.

Identity Theft can make a victim out of all of us in the form of increased prices for goods and services and the loss of peace of mind. This blog seeks to track ongoing developments in identity theft. Dont become a victim. Educate yourself
If car theft were a legitimate business measured by stock analyst firms it would instantly become a Fortune company. Theres a lot of theft going on and despite the fact that thieves arent the most reliable guys on the planet auto theft is well organized. These days discriminating thieves dont simply steal anything they can get their hands on. Theyre stealing for economic gain so they pick and choose. If you own a vehicle thats popular with car buyers odds are it will be popular with thieves too.
All this might sound a bit challenging. You certainly dont want your car to be stolen so what can you as an individual do to protect yourself from the huge and evermoreorganized hazard that can strike at almost any time
. Lock your car. Approximately percent of all vehicles stolen were left unlocked.
. Take your keys. Nearly percent of all vehicles stolen had the keys in them.
. Never hide a second set of keys in your car. It might seem like a good idea but thieves know all the hiding places.
. Park in welllit areas. Over half of all vehicle thefts occur at night and thieves dont like the spotlight.
. When you park in an attended lot leave only the ignition and door key. Dont give the attendant easy access to your glove box and trunk. If you use the same key for your trunk and glove box as for the door have one of them changed. Upon returning check the tires spare and battery to ensure they are the same as those you had when you parked.
. Never leave your car running unattended not even if youll only be gone for a minute. Vehicles are commonly stolen at convenience stores gas stations and ATMs. Many vehicles are also stolen on cold mornings when the owner leaves the vehicle running to warm it up.
. Completely close car windows when parked. Dont make it easier for the thief to enter your vehicle.
. Dont leave valuables in plain view. Why make your car a more desirable target to thieves
. Park your vehicle with wheels turned toward the curb. Many car thieves use tow trucks to steal vehicles so make your car tough to tow away. Wheels should also be turned to the side in driveways and parking lots so the vehicle can only be towed from the front.
. If your vehicle is rearwheel drive back into your driveway. Rear wheels lock on fourwheel drive vehicles making them difficult to tow. Frontwheel drive vehicles should be parked frontend first.
. Always use your emergency brake when parked. In addition to ensuring safety using the emergency brake makes your car harder to tow.
. If you have a garage use it. Parking your vehicle inside protects it from thieves as well as from Mother Nature.
. When parking in a garage lock the garage as well as your vehicle door. By locking both the garage and vehicle doors you greatly improve the chances of deterring a thief.
. Never leave the registration or title in your car. A car thief will use these to sell your stolen car. File the title at your home or office and carry your registration in your purse or wallet.

Medical identity theft is one of the most costly confusing and potentially dangerous types of fraud and a new study shows its on a sharp rise. 
Medical ID theft soared percent in The Ponemon Institute said in its fifth annual survey published Monday. Ponemon estimates more than . million adult Americans or close family members became victims during or before . 
Once someone becomes a victim its extremely difficult to untangle the fraudulent bills and ruined medical records. Criminals can commit medical ID theft by using victims personal information like names birth dates Social Security Numbers or the ID numbers found on insurance cards at medical providers offices to receive services and prescriptions. 
The study compiled data from last year so it doesnt include the potential fallout from the hack of major health insurer Anthem. That attack hit as many as million records Anthem said when the company disclosed the hack earlier this month.

We can learn a great deal from reported identity theft news and recent identity theft stories. Many of us either dont read about the latest identity theft trends or ignore the identity theft lessons that can be extracted from recent identity theft cases in order to manage identity theft challenges more effectively.
The main reason why its important to pay attention to ID theft news especially the regional and national news is because not only cases of identity theft can negatively affect our personal lives and businesses in many ways but also lessons from identity theft cases and recent fraud trends can be extracted and applied to our lives for preventing identity theft and minimizing the potential damage caused by identity theft.
It is amazing to see so many people and businesses are being affected by identity theft in similar manners over and over again as described in reported identity theft news and stories. How many times have we heard stories about people losing their social security card when in fact they dont really need to carry the card with them every day Or how many times have we read stories about workplace information protection or lack thereof whereby an employee takes an unprotected laptop home to be later stolen along with the millions of customer data stored on the computer 
No one wants to be an identity theft victim but somehow we dont think that identity theft stories reported in the news can happen to us because we think we are doing all the right things. The fact is identity theft threats constantly evolve and we should not rely on a static strategy for identity theft protection because a static strategy for preventing identity theft is doomed to fail at some point as identity theft crime evolves. 
In order to maintain an effective identity protection strategy which addresses recent and known identity theft threats by leveraging the most recent solutions especially when technical and automated tools are introduced to help us be more effective and efficient in our identity protection efforts we must consider reported news about identity theft and recent stories about identity theft. Company risk assessments are typically designed to identify threats and lack of adequate protection against such threats which we can similarly apply to our personal lives to maintain a dynamic identity theft protection strategy. One effective way to identify threats and solutions is to pay attention to recent identity theft stories and news. Current stories about identity theft are great ways to learn about the threats of identity theft consequences and actions taken by companies and people who have faced identity theft cases and their unwanted consequences. Below we have listed news sources for identity theft as well as stories we receive from our readers for your information.

According to rumours that just wont go away a sequel to Red Dead Redemption is in the works but with all of this whispering its easy to forget that Grand Theft Auto V will be three years old in September. As such it comes as no real surprise that a new report is stating Rockstars begun work on the inevitable Grand Theft.
Last week we reported that Grand Theft Auto Vs story based downloadable content may still be happening. The actor that plays Franklin one of the games three main characters posted a photo of himself wearing a motion capture suit on Instagram which unsurprisingly lead to plenty of speculation. 
Well here we are again back with another possible Grand Theft Auto V story DLC tease. Shawn Fonteno the man behind Franklin one of the games three main playable characters has posted a picture of himself in a motion capture suit on his Instagram account. Dont get your hopes up just yet though as Fonteno doesnt.
Rumours have been swirling for a while now that Rockstar has been working on some sort of single player expansion for Grand Theft Auto V but those whispers have been silenced by design director Imran Sarwar who told IGN that the developers current focus is purely is on the multiplayer side of things. 
Franklin Michael and Trevor should jack in their thug lives and learn to become game developers instead after all Grand Theft Auto V proves that theres more money in this industry anyway. As revealed by Rockstars parent company TakeTwo during a financial call overnight the fifth instalment in its.
The Lab a Grand Theft Auto V radio station that was PC exclusive is coming to consoles next month. It consists of songs from the games original soundtrack but remixed and repurposed by a slew of musicians from a variety of genres. Basically if youve ever wanted Freddie Gibbs and Wavves on the same station this is for you. Were big.
While its clear that Rockstar Games could charge for additional content in Grand Theft Auto Online its adopted a different model entirely flogging optional Shark Cards for those who want them while allowing everyone else to earn its riches of content for free. And starting next week Los Santos will be taking delivery of a brand.
BBCs planned television drama currently titled Game Changer is about the controversy surrounding Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto series. The plot follows the long dispute between Sam Houser Rockstars president and Jack Thompson the outspoken lawyer and critic who says that video games cause real world violence. 
So remember back when Rockstar Games said that Grand Theft Auto V would be getting some storybased DLC Yeah like a super long time ago Turns out that never happened. Crazy right But when TakeTwo CEO Strauss Zelnick was asked about any upcoming content in a recent earnings call he seemed a bit dazed.
We wonder how many hours UK gamers have spent hammering the X button to sprint in Grand Theft Auto V its got to be quite a lot right We may have reservations about the controls in Rockstar Games open world opus but theres no denying the titles overall quality its a stunning release that puts almost all other sandboxes to.
You may have been jealously eyeing the various video clips and machinima that PC players have been creating for Grand Theft Auto V and pondering whether youll ever be able to join the fun. The good news then is that Rockstar Games is busy beavering away on a simplified version of the movie editing suite for the PlayStation .
Alright who mucked up Grand Theft Auto Vs graphics Therell be some nervous glances at Rockstar North today as the developer has admitted that this weeks downgrade story is actually due to a bug. Eagle eyed Reddit users were in uproar a few days ago when it emerged that the titles latest patch had stripped back several visual.
Bit of a weird one this but YouTube user ElAnalistaDeBits reckons that the PlayStation version of Grand Theft Auto V has suffered a graphical downgrade after the games latest update. On Reddit opinions are torn as to why this might be. Some argue that its a purposeful move with Rockstar having to tweak things in order to add.
Rockstars being predictably cagey with regards to Grand Theft Auto Vs forthcoming online Heists so were working with a bit of speculation this evening. Nevertheless reports are rampant that the free update due out on th March on the PlayStation will weigh in at around .GB on the Xbox One.
Grand Theft Auto Vs forthcoming Heists update will add more than just multilayered missions to the online component of Rockstar Games incredibly popular open world.

Identity theft is Britains fastestgrowing whitecollar crime increasing at nearly a year. 
Most victims of identity theft are reimbursed by banks for money stolen from them but they suffer nonetheless.
Identity theft can also go on for months or years without the victims knowledge.
Fraudsters bribe burglars and postmen for bank statements which contain enough data to open new accounts and take out fraudulent loans in your name. 
Include public records like the Land Registry Companies House and the Electoral Roll and theres not a lot about you that cant be discovered. 
Identity thieves can get your mail redirected or apply for creditcards using your name and your real address as the former address on the application.
And often you decide to withdraw wads of cash from your bank account presenting just enough ID information to convince busy counter staff.
California keeps a register of ID theft victims and Los Angeles has a detective squad dedicated to the crime.
One victim was a young lawyer. On her first day at San Diegos District Attorneys office she was arrested handcuffed and marched off to jail for crimes her identity thief had committed.
A Londoner had false credit accounts opened in his name at Oxford Street stores and thousands of pounds spent before he found out about them.
Or how about the businessman who had his impeccable credit record damaged by an impersonator who had changed the electoral register. 
In the West Country an accomplished fraudster systematically emptied the bank accounts of numerous small companies using impersonation and stolen financial details.
That fraudster Glenn Davies now in jail told the Money Programme about his role in a nationwide ring of identity thieves which utilises private financial information supplied by corrupt bank staff.
Be careful whom you give private financial information to and tear up documents like creditcard slips before discarding them.
If you think you may be a victim then send off for your creditreference files from Experian and Equifax it only costs .
They will show any fraudulent applications for credit. Inform CIFAS the Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System which will put your name on an alert file. 
But there is no escaping the fact that right now fraudsters are finding this crime all too easy.
And that even if your losses are made good you can suffer huge disruption embarrassment and fear when somebody filches your good name. 
The Money Programme investigation into Identity Theft was broadcast on BBC and on BBC News Online at BST GMT on Monday.

A pair of bold thieves returned to the scene of the crime and stole the same truck two days in a row.
Lee County sheriffs deputies said a man and a woman stole a Ford F twice from a gated area on James Whitehead Road then ditched it both times in the same spot along a trail near Briarcliff Road.
Nearby resident Robert Lucas said he noticed something other than the typical fourwheelers.
Another neighbor walked by and said Hey theres a truck back there he said. Thats unusual. You might see them drive through but never parked.
The truck was returned to its owner after the initial theft and he called Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers the next day to let them know that lightning had struck twice.
The fact that they hit the same exact victim and same exact car in the same exact dump location twice is a little odd said Crime Stoppers coordinator Trish Routte.
She said the two suspects are wanted in connection with at least three thefts or attempted thefts in the area. Deputies will use surveillance video to assist in the investigation.
Many owners enable problems by not locking vehicles or leaving valuables in plain sight. But the truck Routte said was locked.

Identity theft was the top consumer complaint of according to the FTC. Getty ImagesiStockphoto
Scammers are busy targeting government records to steal your identity according to a report from the Federal Trade Commission. 
The FTC report cites identity theft as the No. consumer complaint of putting it at the top of the list for the th consecutive year. Of . million complaints made to the commission state and federal law enforcement agencies national consumer protection organizations and nongovernmental organizations percent were about identity theft with debt collection and impostor scams accounting for percent each. 
Separately the Identity Theft Resource Center reported data breaches in a spike of . percent from . 
Once again the most common way for thieves to impersonate someone else was through misusing government documents and records. That type of identity theft has decreased however accounting for percent of all complaints in compared with percent of all grievances in . Credit card fraud became a more common form of identity theft increasing from percent of all complaints in to percent in . 
This relatively frequent fraud involving wage tax and credit card records is likely why the FTC says Americans older than and younger than are most at risk of being impersonated by a scammer since they are more likely to be steadily employed and to use credit accounts. 
Florida was home by far to the most consumer grievances tallying for fraud and other complaints and related to identity theft. Washington notched the secondhighest number of complaints related to identity theft followed by Oregon Missouri and Georgia. 
Georgia was among the states that experienced an apparent spike in potentially fraudulent tax returns being filed through the TurboTax software. Such complaints led the FBI last month to open an investigation into whether a data breach paved the way for scam artists attempting to steal tax refunds according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Identity theft like many cybersecurity problems can often be prevented by using better online habits to protect your personal information. 
Sharing government information like Social Security numbers online outside of a protected site for a legitimate service like a bank can make it easier for thieves to obtain and misuse credentials. And Web advertisements or emails promising deals that sound too good to be true are often hoaxes designed to scam people into giving away vital information. 
Tax returns also are a favorite target of online thieves so be wary of services that make filing a return extremely easy especially if they offer the use of mobile or tablet applications that may have inferior privacy protections or security policies. The FTC recommends thoroughly researching a tax preparation service before using one. 
Shredding correspondence like tax documents once they are no longer needed is another way to prevent identity theft while enacting a credit freeze that blocks people from accessing your credit report or opening an account without permission can prevent information from being misused if your wallet falls into the wrong hands.

A Hamas commander who was executed in Februarywas tortured and then killed after at least one terrorist under his command admitted to having sex with him.
Hamas sources gave few details of the reasons behind the execution at the time with some saying theAl Qassam Brigades commander was accused of spying for Israel while an official statement fromthe Brigades military and Islamic judicialcommittee said only that he was killed for violatingrules and ethics.
According to a New York Times investigationMahmoud Ishtiwi who hailed from a prominent proHamas family and was responsiblewas for a range of operations including overseeing weapons smuggling through Hamass tunnel network was initially called in for questioning by Hamas over suspicions he had siphoned off money meant for buying weapons.
When Ishtiwi surprised interrogators by immediately confessing to that crime they suspected he was attempting to cover up something bigger and took him in for further interrogation. Relatives and other sources say he was tortured extensively during that period including beatings whippings being suspended by his handsfrom the ceiling for hours on end sleep deprivation and more.
So bad were his conditions that family members protested outside the home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in a rare show of dissent in authoritarianruled Gaza. Demonstrators were beaten by Hamas police and dispersed.
According to the report details of which were confirmed by a Hamas official close to the investigation itself the investigation was eventually expanded to include terrorists under Ishtiwis command.
Specifically Hamas officials suspected Ishtiwi may have helped the IDF locate elusive AlQassam chief Mohammed Deif during Operation Protective Edge in . Deif was reportedly injured in an Israeli airstrike which killed his wife but escaped alive.
Ishtiwi eventually confessed to all the charges against him but relatives who saw him in the days before his execution say he appeared destroyed and had secretly written the word wronged on his hand and leg indicating that his confessions had been made under duress.
Shortly before he was killed his sister said he told her he had never committed any of the acts he was accused of.
As a last resort his mother sent a video message to Mohammed Deif himsef who the family had sheltered on numerous occasions begging for clemency.
Highly anticipated video game Grand Theft Auto GTA IV has received a string of nearperfect reviews ahead of its worldwide release.
The game is expected to break records for the fastestselling game of all time and many shops opened their doors at midnight for gamers.
US regulators have reminded parents that the title is not designed for children under years old.
In the UK shops are understood to have put the game on sale at midnight including outlets in Stevenage Hertfordshire Milton Keynes Buckinghamshire Hammersmith in west London and Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent.
UKbased games website Eurogamer called it game of the year and handed it a out of review score while the New York Times said it delivered a new level of depth for an interactive entertainment experience.
In a joint statement the ESRB and the National Institute on Media and the Family urged parents to check ratings on games for their children.
The GTA series has proved incredibly popular and almost equally controversial in the last few years.
Analysts predict the game in which your character Nikko aims to survive the mean streets of a fictional New York will top last years recordbreaking m firstweek sales of firstperson shooter Halo .
The games launch has also been notable for the lack of marketing hype with a limited series of TV spots and advertising hoardings.
Rockstar wants to control the message all the time Sam Kennedy editorial director for gaming site UP.com told AP news agency.
They want this to be seen and perceived exactly the way they want. Thats why outside of the official trailers they released people havent seen a lot of gameplay footage in advance of GTA IV shipping.
Most reviewers were not sent advance copies of the game and instead had to attend Rockstar offices or sit in booked hotel rooms to play the game.
More than million copies of the franchises titles have been sold worldwide but the series has also been criticised for glorifying violence. 
The minigame dubbed Hot Coffee was never designed to be played by gamers but was unlocked by hackers.
Controversy over Hot Coffee resulted in the title being rerated in the US for adults only and games being withdrawn from sale so that stickers with the new rating could be applied.

The trees areintentionally left unpruned thatsthe way they would have been by ancient Hawaiians who lived at the site.
The first western mapping of Mauna lua was done in the s.That coconut grove is in that map so those trees you see there are the keiki of those who have fallen before said Ann Marie Kirk member of the cultural and natural resource committee for the Livable Hawaii Kai Hui.
This is an area thats over years old.Theres been worship and people actually living there too.Theres a village site below. When you look at that heiau and you walk those grounds youre walking on grounds people have walked on for years Kirk said.
Police say coconuts are often sold on the windward side for each.Kirk and Camp are hoping a greater understanding and appreciation of the land can help prevent such petty crime.
This is where I live this is the community where I live.And you invest yourself into that you invest your spirit into that site.And the more that happens the more I think you will have communities stepping forward Kirk said.

BARDSTOWN KY WAVE The man described as a theft suspect by the Bardstown Police Department and whose picture the BPDposted on its Facebook page this week turned himself in Saturday. 
Daimyn Lindsey surrendered to authorities after seeing his picture on television Friday night according to Bardstown Detective Jason Woodson.Lindsey was set to be booked into the Nelson County Jail late Saturday afternoon Woodson said.
On Thursday officials posted a photograph of Lindsey on Facebookand askedfor the publics assistance in locating him.
Police later provided details revealing Lindsey alleged link to a car theft that happened in the parking lot of an apartment complex on Ashberry Drivein Bardstown.
The victim actually knew him by name Woodson said. He was asking her for a ride before she went inside. She actually left her keys in the car and some groceries and came back out and it was gone.
Police believe Lindsey is linked to the stolen Chevy Impalataken Dec.. A couple days laterthe car was found abandoned nearly miles away off Westport Road. Louisville Metro Police impounded thecar which is how Woodson discovered it after it was entered into an electronic crime database. He retrieved the car and returned it to the victim.
She said the back end shakes and some items are missing Woodson said. We also discovered items we believe belong to the suspect.
Bardstown Police Detectives are turning more to social media to help locate crime suspects these days.
The post about Lindsey was shared dozens of times. Police officers increasingly find social media to be a friendly tool to use for investigations.
The public is willing to help us any way they can because they dont want these crimes to happen as well Woodson said. We use it as a partnership.

Five men and two women have been sentenced to a total of more than years in prison after conspiring to target elderly people at supermarkets across Kent.
The offenders all from the Dagenham area pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to commit fraud after elderly people were conned out of thousands of pounds.
The fraudsters obtained Personal Identification Numbers PINs from the victims by shoulder surfing at supermarket checkouts or cash machines. Typically they would watch the victim input their PIN then distract them in a car park using techniques such as asking for directions to the local hospital in order to steal the victims bank cards while distracted.
Between January and March offences were reported in Sevenoaks Tonbridge Maidstone Strood Rainham Gillingham Sittingbourne Whitstable Hawkinge Folkestone and Hythe. All victims were elderly people the eldest being yearsold.
Using store CCTV and Automatic Number Plate Recognition technology ANPR detectives carried out extensive research and identified a Ford Focus and a Volkswagen Passat they believed were involved in the offences.
On March a day when three separate offences occurred in Kent the two vehicles were located and stopped by Kent Police officers in Ilford in East London. The cars were searched and bank cards were found concealed behind a headlight compartment in one of the cars.
Andrea Tanca Danut Carabulea Andranache Tanca Fabiola Preda Alin Gologan Ilie Lazarescu and yearold Fanica Preda were all arrested and as the scale of their offending became apparent detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate were called in to investigate.
Further offencesThe group was linked to a thirteenth offence which occurred in Hertfordshire on March . In all their victims were defrauded out of more than . Fonica Preda also known as Fonica Simionescu later admitted to further offences which had taken place in Hertfordshire dating back March .
The common factor in all these offences was that the offenders targeted elderly or vulnerable people. The offenders worked in teams and once they had the victims PIN they acted quickly to confuse or distract the victims in the car park whilst simultaneously stealing their bank cards. They operated across Kent sometimes swapping clothing to avoid detection but we collected a huge amount of CCTV and electronic data that put them firmly in the location when the offences were taking place. When we inevitably caught up with them and our evidence was put to them they were left with little choice but to plead guilty. This has been a long running investigation but its conclusion is very satisfying and we will continue to pursue those who target the most vulnerable in society.

A Georgia man found himself in handcuffs after charging his electric car outside a middle school where his son was playing tennis in what police alleged was unlawful theft of county power worth roughly five cents. 
Kaveh Kamooneh of Decatur said he was attending a Saturday morning tennis practice session for his yearold son on Nov. when he plugged in his electric car at a power outlet outside Chamblee Middle School. 
Kamooneh said he was alarmed when soon after he saw a police officer inspecting his Nissan LEAF. 
According to a report from the Chamblee Police Department an officer responded to a called complaint of the white Nissan LEAF left parked and charging at the school. In the police report the officer said he could not find the vehicles owner but found the car doors unlocked and picked up a piece of mail on the car floor showing a Decatur address. 
He told me he was going to arrest me for theft Kamooneh said who said he charged his car for roughly minutes. Clean Cities Atlanta an electric vehicle advocacy group says that is roughly the equivalent of a nickels worth of electricityWIXA in Atlanta reported. 
On Nov. Kamooneh said he was met at his door by police who handcuffed him and took him to the DeKalb County jail where he was held for about hours. 
I quickly realized it was from the events that had happened days back he said. The officer did threaten that he would do that. I guess I didnt quite believe that he would go through with it. 
Kamooneh was officially charged with theft by taking what the officer said was theft of power by not seeking permission from the DeKalb County School system to charge his car there according to the police report. 
Police said according to the report they met with Chamblee Middle School employees who confirmed that Kamooneh was not authorized to plug his car into any school socket. 
Sgt. Ernesto Ford of the of the Chamblee Police Department declined to discuss the incident further with NBC News but told WXIAthat Kamooneh broke the law. He stole something that wasnt his. 
But Kamooneh said he believes he committed no crime. He said in his experience as an electric car driver seeking permission was often an informal exchange and that he had never encountered a problem before. 
Of course I agree that theft is theft what I dont agree with is that every taking of something without permission is theft he said adding that there was no one at the school to ask permission from at the time. 
The DeKalb County School District said in a statement that it has cooperated with the police investigation and will continue to do so. 
If car theft were a legitimate business measured by stock analyst firms it would instantly become a Fortune company. Theres a lot of theft going on and despite the fact that thieves arent the most reliable guys on the planet auto theft is well organized. These days discriminating thieves dont simply steal anything they can get their hands on. Theyre stealing for economic gain so they pick and choose. If you own a vehicle thats popular with car buyers odds are it will be popular with thieves too.
All this might sound a bit challenging. You certainly dont want your car to be stolen so what can you as an individual do to protect yourself from the huge and evermoreorganized hazard that can strike at almost any time
. Lock your car. Approximately percent of all vehicles stolen were left unlocked.
. Take your keys. Nearly percent of all vehicles stolen had the keys in them.
. Never hide a second set of keys in your car. It might seem like a good idea but thieves know all the hiding places.
. Park in welllit areas. Over half of all vehicle thefts occur at night and thieves dont like the spotlight.
. When you park in an attended lot leave only the ignition and door key. Dont give the attendant easy access to your glove box and trunk. If you use the same key for your trunk and glove box as for the door have one of them changed. Upon returning check the tires spare and battery to ensure they are the same as those you had when you parked.
. Never leave your car running unattended not even if youll only be gone for a minute. Vehicles are commonly stolen at convenience stores gas stations and ATMs. Many vehicles are also stolen on cold mornings when the owner leaves the vehicle running to warm it up.
. Completely close car windows when parked. Dont make it easier for the thief to enter your vehicle.
. Dont leave valuables in plain view. Why make your car a more desirable target to thieves
. Park your vehicle with wheels turned toward the curb. Many car thieves use tow trucks to steal vehicles so make your car tough to tow away. Wheels should also be turned to the side in driveways and parking lots so the vehicle can only be towed from the front.
. If your vehicle is rearwheel drive back into your driveway. Rear wheels lock on fourwheel drive vehicles making them difficult to tow. Frontwheel drive vehicles should be parked frontend first.
. Always use your emergency brake when parked. In addition to ensuring safety using the emergency brake makes your car harder to tow.
. If you have a garage use it. Parking your vehicle inside protects it from thieves as well as from Mother Nature.
. When parking in a garage lock the garage as well as your vehicle door. By locking both the garage and vehicle doors you greatly improve the chances of deterring a thief.
. Never leave the registration or title in your car. A car thief will use these to sell your stolen car. File the title at your home or office and carry your registration in your purse or wallet.

The IRS doesnt initiate contact with taxpayers by email to request personal or financial information. This includes any type of electronic communication such as text messages and social media channels. The IRS does not call taxpayers with threats of lawsuits or arrests.

A Hamas commander who was executed in Februarywas tortured and then killed after at least one terrorist under his command admitted to having sex with him.
Hamas sources gave few details of the reasons behind the execution at the time with some saying theAl Qassam Brigades commander was accused of spying for Israel while an official statement fromthe Brigades military and Islamic judicialcommittee said only that he was killed for violatingrules and ethics.
According to a New York Times investigationMahmoud Ishtiwi who hailed from a prominent proHamas family and was responsiblewas for a range of operations including overseeing weapons smuggling through Hamass tunnel network was initially called in for questioning by Hamas over suspicions he had siphoned off money meant for buying weapons.
When Ishtiwi surprised interrogators by immediately confessing to that crime they suspected he was attempting to cover up something bigger and took him in for further interrogation. Relatives and other sources say he was tortured extensively during that period including beatings whippings being suspended by his handsfrom the ceiling for hours on end sleep deprivation and more.
So bad were his conditions that family members protested outside the home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in a rare show of dissent in authoritarianruled Gaza. Demonstrators were beaten by Hamas police and dispersed.
According to the report details of which were confirmed by a Hamas official close to the investigation itself the investigation was eventually expanded to include terrorists under Ishtiwis command.
Specifically Hamas officials suspected Ishtiwi may have helped the IDF locate elusive AlQassam chief Mohammed Deif during Operation Protective Edge in . Deif was reportedly injured in an Israeli airstrike which killed his wife but escaped alive.
Ishtiwi eventually confessed to all the charges against him but relatives who saw him in the days before his execution say he appeared destroyed and had secretly written the word wronged on his hand and leg indicating that his confessions had been made under duress.
Shortly before he was killed his sister said he told her he had never committed any of the acts he was accused of.
As a last resort his mother sent a video message to Mohammed Deif himsef who the family had sheltered on numerous occasions begging for clemency.
Identity theft was the top consumer complaint of according to the FTC. Getty ImagesiStockphoto
Scammers are busy targeting government records to steal your identity according to a report from the Federal Trade Commission. 
The FTC report cites identity theft as the No. consumer complaint of putting it at the top of the list for the th consecutive year. Of . million complaints made to the commission state and federal law enforcement agencies national consumer protection organizations and nongovernmental organizations percent were about identity theft with debt collection and impostor scams accounting for percent each. 
Separately the Identity Theft Resource Center reported data breaches in a spike of . percent from . 
Once again the most common way for thieves to impersonate someone else was through misusing government documents and records. That type of identity theft has decreased however accounting for percent of all complaints in compared with percent of all grievances in . Credit card fraud became a more common form of identity theft increasing from percent of all complaints in to percent in . 
This relatively frequent fraud involving wage tax and credit card records is likely why the FTC says Americans older than and younger than are most at risk of being impersonated by a scammer since they are more likely to be steadily employed and to use credit accounts. 
Florida was home by far to the most consumer grievances tallying for fraud and other complaints and related to identity theft. Washington notched the secondhighest number of complaints related to identity theft followed by Oregon Missouri and Georgia. 
Georgia was among the states that experienced an apparent spike in potentially fraudulent tax returns being filed through the TurboTax software. Such complaints led the FBI last month to open an investigation into whether a data breach paved the way for scam artists attempting to steal tax refunds according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Identity theft like many cybersecurity problems can often be prevented by using better online habits to protect your personal information. 
Sharing government information like Social Security numbers online outside of a protected site for a legitimate service like a bank can make it easier for thieves to obtain and misuse credentials. And Web advertisements or emails promising deals that sound too good to be true are often hoaxes designed to scam people into giving away vital information. 
Tax returns also are a favorite target of online thieves so be wary of services that make filing a return extremely easy especially if they offer the use of mobile or tablet applications that may have inferior privacy protections or security policies. The FTC recommends thoroughly researching a tax preparation service before using one. 
Shredding correspondence like tax documents once they are no longer needed is another way to prevent identity theft while enacting a credit freeze that blocks people from accessing your credit report or opening an account without permission can prevent information from being misused if your wallet falls into the wrong hands.

The rerelease of Grand Theft Auto V hasnt only shoved the openworld title back into the spotlight but its portrayal of sex violence and crime is getting a closer look leading some stores in Australia to ban sales of the updated game.
GTA V features an R rating in Australia the equivalent of a Mature rating in the US.
Winter isnt officially here yet but its starting to get darker earlier and for large swathes of the US its pretty cold too. Those two factors keep a lot of people indoors for much of the season. There are few ways better of staving off cabin fever than picking up a controller and burning through the chilly season with a video game. You dont need the latest and greatest console either just check out this cool Robocop mod for Grand Theft Auto IV on the PC.
Weve spilled a lot of virtual ink in our coverage of Grand Theft Auto V. Rockstar Games blockbuster was arguably one of that years very best titles delivering a unique version of automotive mayhem along with all the other things guns sex drugs murder thievery and biting satire that the series has been praised and criticized for.
There is no shortage of things to do in the open world of Grand Theft Auto V. One of the more popular though is recreating iconic scenes from TV and film on the sprawling landmass that is San Andreas. Weve already seen a famous scene from Terminator II get the GTA treatment and now its the turn of everyones favorite mob boss.

We dont much care about any of that though because the big news is that there are a number of new vehicles attached to the update.
Weve seen no shortage of zany stunts in the huge open world of Grand Theft Auto V.

Two men are wanted in the Houston area tonight after they stole an Audi RS from a local dealership. The brazen theft happened in the middle of the business day when a salesperson stepped away after letting one of the men take the car for a test drive while the other sat in the getaway car. He then swiped the keys and his license before running out to the lot and taking off in the horsepower coupe.
Grand Theft Auto is more than just a video game series its a scathing commentary on modern life. The brutal parodies of the game come fast and furious from the start and continue through most of the story. Just hop into a car turn on the radio and go for a cruise around Los Santos and in short order youll hear some truly absurd things. Examples in Grand Theft Auto include a campaign advertisement that lampoons the stuff we hear every few Novembers and the continuing story of a Fr
The Auto portion of Grand Theft Auto V may represent the beating heart of the game thats currently storming the world but dont be confused into thinking that this is a carsonly kind of affair. Veterans of the franchise will recognize that GTA has long offered vehicular experiences of all stripes on land sea and in the air and the fifth iteration it does so more than ever.
Even though our first response was something along the lines of It should have been the Cheetah we will admit that building a reallife version of a Grand Theft Auto V car is a pretty meta pretty cool promotion.
If there was any doubt that the latest installment of the Grand Theft Auto franchise wouldnt be good were pretty certain the games official trailer just released by Rockstar Games will be enough to erase it from the collective minds of the public. Weve got the oneminute launch trailer for Grand Theft Auto V and it shows everything from the cinematic sequences and arguments among the crew to some of the heists that players will be able to undertake.

Police in the UK and particularly in London have noticed a worrying new hightech trend emerging in the way bike thieves track down their targets according to bike crime expert Ken German. While many bikes disappear from the street and thieves have long used the practice of following riders home it appears that theyre now using trackers instead.
With battery powered electronic devices now being very affordable thieves are secreting them on bikes parked in public places then simply waiting for the owner to ride home. No more suspicious following games just sit back and wait. Of course the thieves even get their tracking unit back to use again if they successfully steal the target.
Riders have become far more aware of being followed in recent times which is what has led the thieves to seek other ways to identify a bikes location. Some owners have disturbed thieves as they try to fit units to their bikes.
If you have to leave your bike unattended in public try to park in busy and wellobserved places and firmly secure a bike cover over your bike. If you have any suspicions check your bike thoroughly for foreign objects and always ensure your bike is physically secure at home.

Timing is everything when it comes to taxes. That adage applies not only to filing deadlines we taxpayers face but also to evaluation of the Internal Revenue Service itself.
IRS Commissioner John Koskinen discussed the agencys efforts to fight tax fraud before two Senate committees Tuesday.
Take for example the revelation that criminals were able to access data on tax returns previously filed by around taxpayers. This breach of the IRS Get Transcript online application has been a major black eye for the already embattled federal agency.
Unfortunately for the IRS that May announcement of the security breach completely overshadowed some relatively good news about the agencys overall efforts to stem tax fraud that were discussed in a report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released two days later.
IRS Commissioner John Koskinen was on Capitol Hill this week trying to explain to two separate Senate committees how the criminals were able to get private taxpayer information from the IRS online services.
The commissioner didnt really offer any new details on who was behind the theft which the IRS fears could lead to more tax identity theft fraud attempts next filing season. He once again characterized the tax data breakin as a sophisticated scheme most likely perpetrated by an organized crime syndicate.
Letters have been sent to the taxpayers whose former tax filing data was compromised.
Of that group about taxpayers had already filed their income tax returns before the Get Transcript online breakin. This means the commissioner told senators that those individuals returns and refund claims were not affected because any fraudulent returns subsequently filed in their names would have been automatically rejected by IRS filtering systems.
The IRS has no record for another taxpayer accounts of any return either legitimate or fake having been filed in . This could be the case for example where the associated Social Security numbers belong to individuals who arent required to file a return such as children or people who earned very little income.
IRS fraud filters caught and stopped approximately fraudulent returns before false refunds were issued.
But refunds for the tax year were issued for about suspicious returns. Those refunds totaled around million and the average refund was approximately per return.
Koskinen told lawmakers that the IRS is still determining how many of those filings were by the actual taxpayers and which were filed using stolen identities.
While the public Congress and media were focusing on the Get Transcript identity theft the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration or TIGTA provided some good tax fraud news.
In case you missed it the tax watchdog said in a report completed in April and released May that the IRS continues to make significant improvements in its identification of identity theft tax returns when the fake returns are processed. That means the filings are stopped before fraudulent tax refunds are issued.
IRS data shows that as of last October the agencys tax fraud filters identified tax returns and prevented the issuance of approximately . billion in fraudulent tax refunds according to the TIGTA report. For the overall filing season the IRS caught approximately . billion in identity theft refund fraud.
Of course since TIGTAs job is to keep the IRS on its toes the inspectors office said the tax agency could do more. Still given the issues the IRS has been dealing with in recent years and the tax ID theft trouble this month any good news is welcome.
Are you in one of the five groups at most risk for identity theft If so you might want to check into ID theft insurance.
Worried there may be mistakes on your credit report Check it for free at myBankrate.com.
This story mainly raises the problems of the IRS and that they only admit .B in fraudulent refunds processed and not to the damage done to the taxpayers in the data theft.
Because the IRS may have released OUR joint tax data to the fraudsters through a fake IRS Get Transcript Account MY tax records and My Social Security may have also been included. We called the IRS and were only told they dont know what actual information was compromised or when the theft happened but they are investigating.
In the meantime we are experiencing a major headache on the Credit Reports front obtaining the IRS IP PIN closing the tax refund direct deposit bank account and the general dread of next tax season. ps the IRS offered my wife a year credit monitoring which will do nothing regarding taxes
The only thing I could suggest to you is to hire an attorneyif you can not afford one almost every law school in my area has clinics.These help people in need also there is various legal aid clinics and lawyers who do pro bono work.You probably have to file suit in the federal District Court that would be the venue of record.Good luck and have a nice day.
This article is well written and gives some hope to the victims and future possible victims.The issue is the hackers the Internal Revenue Service has quality employees who can work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and hopefully arrest these people.The problem is the new crop of hackers that are coming of age.
The real fraud is the tax code. After my wife died I of course became a single tax payer. What an eye opener. If your income is over you jump from a federal tax rate of to a tax rate of which is a rate increase over what your rate is when your taxable income is under .
In the mean time the truly wealthy who may well have huge capital gain income pay far less.
I would love to see a flat tax for all of us who fall well below the half million dollars in income that many in this country receive.
a few years after I applied and received My Social Security Number The IRS or the Social Security Office issued My Number To Another person.
To this I have documentation When I call the Social Security About this they just Told Me that THEY DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES 
Wanna know of all of these tax fraud fillings..how many were identified and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

WASHINGTON AP The Internal Revenue Service may have delivered more than billion in refund checks to identity thieves who filed fraudulent tax returns for Treasury Department investigators said Thursday. They estimate another billion could make its way to ID thieves pockets over the next five years.
The IRS is detecting far fewer fraudulent tax refund claims than actually occur according to a government audit that warned the widespread problem could undermine public trust in the U.S. tax system. Although the IRS detected about fraudulent returns for last year claiming . billion in refunds there were potentially another . million undetected cases of thieves seeking refunds after assuming the identity of a dead person child or someone else who normally wouldnt file a tax return.
In one example investigators found a single address in Lansing Mich. that was used to file separate tax returns. The IRS issued more than . million in refunds to that address. Three addresses in Florida the epicenter of the identity theft crisis filed more than returns totaling more than million in refunds for each address.
In another troubling scenario hundreds of refunds were deposited into the same bank account a red flag for investigators searching for ID thieves who may be filing for refunds for multiple people. In one instance the IRS deposited refunds totaling more than into one account.
We found multiple reasons for the IRSs inability to detect billions of dollars in fraud J. Russell George the Treasury Departments inspector general for tax administration in a statement. At a time when every dollar counts these results are extremely troubling.
Topping the list of concerns is the IRSs lack of timely access to thirdparty information it needs to verify returns and root out fraud.
Many Americans are struggling to pay their bills and the IRS takes pride in processing returns and issuing refunds promptly. But taxpayers can start filing their returns in midJanuary while employers and financial institutions dont have to submit withholding and income documents for taxpayers to the IRS until the end of March. That means the IRS often issues refunds long before it can confirm the veracity of whats listed on taxpayer returns.
Thieves are also exploiting vulnerabilities in the way the IRS delivers refunds investigators found. Of the . million undetected cases of potential fraud . million used direct deposits including preloaded debit cards. Thieves often prefer those methods to a paper check which require a physical address to receive the check and photo ID matching the taxpayers name to cash it.
IRS officials said the growth of identity theftrelated fraud is one of its biggest challenges. Already this year the agency has stopped almost billion in confirmed fraud it says. And it says its criminal investigators are actively pursuing those who perpetrate fraud including the previously undetected cases identified by the audit.
If the IRS determines a refund has been issued improperly we will attempt to recoup the funds said IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge.
The IRS agreed with the inspector general that Congress should expand the agencys access to resources that could help it fight theft including the National Directory of New Hires a database created to help states enforce child support orders. The IRS specifically asked Congress for that authority in its budget request.
But IRS officials disputed the notion that billion in fraudulent returns could be issued over the next five years arguing that the estimate didnt take into account the IRSs steppedup compliance and prevention efforts.
Were going to continue to monitor the IRS in this area until we see some improvement Michael McKenney the acting deputy inspector general for audit told The Associated Press.
Investigators went back through a sample of the . billion undetected cases to see why the IRS never flagged them as fraudulent. In of returns investigators said the return didnt score high enough on the IRSs fraud filter to merit a closer review. In eight of the cases where the IRS did perform an additional review it never verified the income and withholding on the return.
Its an ongoing problem Nelson said in a statement. Weve got to find a fix.
Nelsons bill would improve protections for Social Security numbers that thieves need to file returns and would expand an existing program that gives previous victims of ID theft a personal identification number to deter repeat offenses against the same taxpayer. Another bipartisan bill passed by the House on Wednesday would bolster prosecutions and strengthen criminal penalties on ID thieves.
The IRS said it is already putting a number of new measures in place including new ID theft screening filters that will hold on to refunds until the IRS can verify a taxpayers identity. That filter had thwarted about . billion in potentially fraudulent refunds through April the audit said. Another system flags returns filed with Social Security numbers of those who have died.
For those who fall victim to identity thieves the recovery process can be less than smooth. A separate report by the inspector general in May found that the IRS wasnt providing good customer service and proper assistance to victims of ID theft increasing the burden for those whose identities are stolen. The Federal Trade Commission has listed identity theft as the No. consumer complaint for the past years.

Once again the most common way for thieves to impersonate someone else was through misusing government documents and records. That type of identity theft has decreased however accounting for percent of all complaints in compared with percent of all grievances in . Credit card fraud became a more common form of identity theft increasing from percent of all complaints in to percent in . 
This relatively frequent fraud involving wage tax and credit card records is likely why the FTC says Americans older than and younger than are most at risk of being impersonated by a scammer since they are more likely to be steadily employed and to use credit accounts. 
Florida was home by far to the most consumer grievances tallying for fraud and other complaints and related to identity theft. Washington notched the secondhighest number of complaints related to identity theft followed by Oregon Missouri and Georgia. 
Georgia was among the states that experienced an apparent spike in potentially fraudulent tax returns being filed through the TurboTax software. Such complaints led the FBI last month to open an investigation into whether a data breach paved the way for scam artists attempting to steal tax refunds according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Identity theft like many cybersecurity problems can often be prevented by using better online habits to protect your personal information. 
Sharing government information like Social Security numbers online outside of a protected site for a legitimate service like a bank can make it easier for thieves to obtain and misuse credentials. And Web advertisements or emails promising deals that sound too good to be true are often hoaxes designed to scam people into giving away vital information. 
Tax returns also are a favorite target of online thieves so be wary of services that make filing a return extremely easy especially if they offer the use of mobile or tablet applications that may have inferior privacy protections or security policies. The FTC recommends thoroughly researching a tax preparation service before using one. 
Shredding correspondence like tax documents once they are no longer needed is another way to prevent identity theft while enacting a credit freeze that blocks people from accessing your credit report or opening an account without permission can prevent information from being misused if your wallet falls into the wrong hands.

It has been quite some time since weve had any updates on Lindsay Lohan lawsuit againstthe makers of the Grand Theft Auto series for allegedly using her likeness in Grand Theft Auto Vwithout permission.
As we previously reported Lohan is suing TakeTwo and Rockstar Games because she believes the character of Lacey Jonas in GTAV was an unequivocal reference to her. TakeTwo claims that the only thing the two have in common is that both are young and blonde. TakeTwo also went on to say that Lohan brought on the lawsuit for publicity purposes.
Many believed that this case would be thrown out before it even went to trial such as the recent lawsuit by Manuel Noriega against Activision over his likeness being used in Call of Duty. According to the Hollywood reporter whoever New York Supreme Court judge Joan Kennedy wrote in a ruling on Friday that the case would not be dismissed.
Lindsay Lohan isnt one who is unfamiliar with a court room given how many times she has been arrested for driving under the influence among other things. Her luck with lawsuits isnt much better either so this situation can be seen as a small victory on her part. This lawsuit is still in its early stages however so well keep you updated on any new developments.
Home Office report into vehicle security finds motorcycle theft has risen since 
A HOME OFFICE reportinto vehicle security and crime has found that motorcycle theft in London rose by a staggering in compared with figures from .
Some of the data used in the report comes from Londons Metropolitan police and shows that additional bikes were stolen in compared to .
The figures mirror findings by the Retail Motor Industry Federations analysis of data from the police national computer which indicates that bike theft in England and Wales rose during .
The reasons for the findings are unclear. The report notes that the rise in motorcycle thefts isnt a reflection of more bikes on the road because numbers have been largely flat since the recession.
Two suggestions are that with cars gaining increasingly sophisticated security features thieves are being deterred from stealing them so are targeting bikes instead.
Media reports also propose a link between stolen motorcycles and other crimes and that stolen bikes are being used to commit other crimes. If true it likely means that motorcycles are being stolen specifically for the purpose of committing crime.
Met police data shows that there were recorded crimes in London involving suspects on mopeds or motorbikes during the months leading up to February .
Data used in the report indicates that due to a drop in car thefts motorbike thefts now make up a larger portion of overall vehicle thefts grouping together figures since puts it at .
There were recorded vehicle thefts in England and Wales in although the figure is likely higher since that number does not include vehicles taken in burglaries which are recorded as burglaries not as thefts of vehicles in police figures.
A Hamas commander who was executed in Februarywas tortured and then killed after at least one terrorist under his command admitted to having sex with him.
Hamas sources gave few details of the reasons behind the execution at the time with some saying theAl Qassam Brigades commander was accused of spying for Israel while an official statement fromthe Brigades military and Islamic judicialcommittee said only that he was killed for violatingrules and ethics.
According to a New York Times investigationMahmoud Ishtiwi who hailed from a prominent proHamas family and was responsiblewas for a range of operations including overseeing weapons smuggling through Hamass tunnel network was initially called in for questioning by Hamas over suspicions he had siphoned off money meant for buying weapons.
When Ishtiwi surprised interrogators by immediately confessing to that crime they suspected he was attempting to cover up something bigger and took him in for further interrogation. Relatives and other sources say he was tortured extensively during that period including beatings whippings being suspended by his handsfrom the ceiling for hours on end sleep deprivation and more.
So bad were his conditions that family members protested outside the home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in a rare show of dissent in authoritarianruled Gaza. Demonstrators were beaten by Hamas police and dispersed.
According to the report details of which were confirmed by a Hamas official close to the investigation itself the investigation was eventually expanded to include terrorists under Ishtiwis command.
Specifically Hamas officials suspected Ishtiwi may have helped the IDF locate elusive AlQassam chief Mohammed Deif during Operation Protective Edge in . Deif was reportedly injured in an Israeli airstrike which killed his wife but escaped alive.
Ishtiwi eventually confessed to all the charges against him but relatives who saw him in the days before his execution say he appeared destroyed and had secretly written the word wronged on his hand and leg indicating that his confessions had been made under duress.
Shortly before he was killed his sister said he told her he had never committed any of the acts he was accused of.
As a last resort his mother sent a video message to Mohammed Deif himsef who the family had sheltered on numerous occasions begging for clemency.
A tangle of wire atop this electricity pole in New Delhi India in was testament to the capital citys power theft problems. Since then in North Delhi automation has helped slash electrical losses.
When Pedro Antmann the World Banks senior energy specialist visits developing countries utility officials almost invariably take him to the slums where he sees tangles of electrical wires amid shanties.
Its true that many poor people unable to pay for electricity illegally tap the grid. But they are scrambling to power lights fans and TVsnot air conditioners large refrigerators and other energygobbling appliances.
Rather some of the biggest culprits are large residential commercial and industrial consumers who avoid paying their fair share of electricity often by colluding with meter readers current or exutility employees or third parties.
Its impossible for a utility to have high losses without having those losses concentrated in that large consumer segment Antmann said.
Electricity theftrevenues lost from illegal connections unbilled consumption and nonpaymentis difficult to quantify. But in some pockets of South Asia SubSaharan Africa and the former Soviet Union losses reach percent. In other words the utility is collecting half the revenue it should from the power it supplies. Every year in India alone losses are estimated in the billions of dollars.
Such automated twoway equipment can be used to monitor and detect unusual activity such as meter bypassing from remote locations. But technology alone is not enough. Combating energy theft takes will.
What happens in reality in this battle between the utility and the consumer says Antmann . . . is that when the utility says the game is over the game is over.
The beauty of the smart meter strategy is that it eliminates contact between the customer and a utility employee which is often a factor in collusion. In many cases and in an approach Antmann advocates highuse customers are targeted first. Customers using a lot of energy also generally will stop stealing it once they realize the utility has the tools to detect and record the theft Antmann said.
Bob Gohn Smart Grid research director for U.S.based Pike Research which tracks the industry concurred that smart metering increasingly is being used to address energy theft in many parts of the world and he expects it to continue to increase.
The biggest areas we have seen thus far have been in India and Latin America most specifically in Brazil he said by email. Brazils government last year mandated installation of more than million smart meters by .
Combating theft is certainly not the only driver for this initiative but is the primary reason for early smart meter deployments in selected urban areas Gohn said. Brazil is under additional pressure to improve its power reliability in advance of hosting the World Cup in and the Olympics in .
Extensive programs or pilot projects also have been implemented in the Dominican Republic parts of the former Soviet Union Uganda South Africa and many other locations.
Tapping into live wires is quite literally a dangerous crime. Many people getelectrocuted or seriously injured each year because of electricity theft. In one incident in Sri Lanka last year four men were electrocuted while trying to steal electricity cables. Andjust last month a Sri Lankan newspaper reportedthat a young woman had been electrocuted aftertouchinglivewires rigged up by her husband who had stolen electricity.
High electric losses cripple a utilitys ability to properly invest in its system and provide stable service. Illegal connections not only pose significant safety issues Gohn noted but they prevent a utility from having the accurate view necessary to plan and maintain a good network. In many countries outages become a way of life and power unreliability puts a drag on economic development Gohn said.
High theft rates also raise difficult economic justice issues Gohn added as many stealing electricity cannot afford to pay yet prices are made artificially higher because of nonpayment by them and others.
Gregg Edeson global energy expert for Londonbased PA Consulting Group said smart meters are definitely one of the tools being considered to fight electricity theft in developing countries. But he cautioned At the end of the day its still an expensive alternative.
You have to have a solid business case you dont just jump into this lightly Edeson said.
The business case is similar to one used in the developed world where smart meters historically have been used to improve energy efficiency and to cut consumption and carbon emissions.
A smart meter might cost in the United States but in a developing country the same device could cost because of low volumes and necessary rewiring Edeson said.
Some experts also have raised concerns about the potential for smart meters to be hacked into in efforts to shut them off steal data or disrupt power supplies. But Edeson says the devices are fairly tamper proof if meddled with they send a distress signal that notifies the utility on a nearly realtime basis.
Still Edeson said he doesnt believe it makes sense to put smart meters on the premises of all industrial and commercial customers. But smart meters can absolutely be costeffective if they are placed in a strategic manner such as on a distribution line feeding commercial and industrial customers.
Such a system helps utilities improve the performance of the network and it helps keep employees honest because they know the energy usage overall is being monitored said Edeson who worked in Uganda to develop a pilot program using smart meters.
Millers he said constituted the biggest portion of electricity theft in that African country. They would transport their electric milling machines on the backs of trucks and mill alfalfa barley and wheat on site clamping illegally to power lines.
While placing smart meters on some highuse customer premises is an option other alternatives should be considered as well Edeson said such as trying to understand the collusion thats occurring and provide incentives to build a more trustworthy utility inspection team. There also are physical things a utility can do to prevent theft such as securing meter boxes installing tamper proof cables and using barbed wire to discourage clamping onto power lines.
But Antmann of the World Bank said he disagrees with using smart meters on distribution lines rather than on the premises of large customers.
I saw that approach implemented in some SubSaharan African countries Antmann said. As expected nothing happened in terms of loss reduction and in several cases meters are either not working or not being used by the utilities.
Antmann argued that attaching a smart meter to the premises of a large consumer costs no more than and with that onetime investment you protect on a permanent basis billing and related revenues that can reach a month or more.
He cited North Delhi Power Limited a joint venture formed in by Tata Power and the government of Delhi India. The utility serves about million people in north and northwest Delhi. Smart meters were attached on the premises of the largest consumers as part of a comprehensive reform.
Within about five years total electric losses some were due to transmission and distribution efficiencies as well as theft were slashed from percent to percent largely as the result of automation.
But the fight is not over. In January the utility reported that one of its employees was seriously injured when the owner of a rubbersheet factory and two of his accomplices attacked a theftinspection team with an iron rod and bricks.
Because smart meters eliminate such human contact one can find out quickly whether a utility is eager to root out corruption or maintain the status quo.
After all collusion is a profitable side business that sometimes involves even the senior officials at a utility. Utility officials in turn may enjoy a close relationship with the government. If a utility is reluctant to install a monitoring system it may mean top management is involved in the collusion and for change to occur must be replaced experts say.
The Dominican Republic is a case in point. In its electric system was on the brink of financial collapse plagued by theft nonpayment and rolling blackouts. Smart meters were installed but the corruption didnt stop because the utility failed to act on the data Antmann said. The utilitys management was replaced and the project was restarted he said.
This approach of revenue protection with the use of technology is very effective to help the companies utilities that actually want to be helped Antmann said. Put the tool in the hands of thieves and it doesnt work.
There have been some impressive results since then. Antmann said he was involved in a project in the Dominican Republic where one utilitys investment in smart meters paid for itself in recovered revenues in seven months.
If efforts are being targeted to reduce theft among the big users of electricity what happens to poor people in the meantime
Kavita Rai program manager for the Londonbased Global Village Energy Partnership which works to help the poor gain access to energy noted the poor are often the last to be considered because of the high upfront costs to serve them and the poor rate of return.
While going after highuse customers that dont pay their fair share may be beneficial reducing electricity theft alone wont help the poor she said. Whats needed is for utilities to come up with favorable tariffs and innovative approaches to enable the poor to pay the upfront cost of connection she said.
Its being done in parts of the world but not being done with great vigor she said.
Antmann agrees the poor need extra help but says collecting revenue from large customers can serve as an important first step.
You cant improve the problem countrywide until you solve the problem in the highvalue segment Antmann said. Thats always the first step. Once you do that you can design and implement an approach for the rest of the market.

Fort Walton Beach resident Cedric Fearson has been cleared of a charge that he stole over from the Target store in Destin.
Fort Walton Beach resident Cedric Fearson has been cleared of a charge that he stole over from the Target store in Destin.
A codefendant in the case Thelda Jean Kent of Crestview has received a month suspended sentence and will spend years on probation said Bill Bishop the chief assistant state attorney for Okaloosa County.
Fearson and Kent were arrested in June of and charged with illegally adding items to pallets of merchandise Target was providing as salvaged goods to a charity known as Others of Destin.
An arrest report said Kent who worked for Target was piling things like electronics and furniture onto pallets full of goods the retailer routinely provided to charitable organizations at a hefty discount.
The Okaloosa County Sheriffs Office estimated as much as was illegally taken from Target. A search of Kents home found more than in property identified as stolen.
Bishop said the State Attorneys Office found it could not prove that Fearson whose job was retrieving the pallets Kent loaded would have known what Kent had stolen and what was being legitimately donated.
Through a computersimulated study astronomers at Lund University in Sweden show that it is highly likely that the socalled Planet is an exoplanet. This would make it the first exoplanet to be discovered inside our own solar system. The theory is that our sun in its youth some . billion years ago stole Planet from its original star.
An extrasolar planet or exoplanet is by definition a planet located outside our solar system. Now it appears that this definition is no longer viable. According to astronomers in Lund there is a lot to indicate that Planet was captured by the young sun and has been a part of our solar system completely undetected ever since.
It is almost ironic that while astronomers often find exoplanets hundreds of light years away in other solar systems theres probably one hiding in our own backyard says Alexander Mustill astronomer at Lund University.
Stars are born in clusters and often pass by one another. It is during these encounters that a star can steal one or more planets in orbit around another star. This is probably what happened when our own sun captured Planet .
In a computersimulated model Alexander together with astronomers in Lund and Bordeaux has shown that Planet was probably captured by the sun when coming in close contact while orbiting another star.
Planet may very well have been shoved by other planets and when it ended up in an orbit that was too wide around its own star our sun may have taken the opportunity to steal and capture Planet from its original star. When the sun later departed from the stellar cluster in which it was born Planet was stuck in an orbit around the sun says Alexander Mustill.
There is still no image of Planet not even a point of light. We dont know if it is made up of rock ice or gas. All we know is that its mass is probably around ten times the mass of earth.
It requires a lot more research before it can be ascertained that Planet is the first exoplanet in our solar system. If the theory is correct Alexander Mustill believes that the study of space and the understanding of the sun and the Earth will take a giant leap forward.
This is the only exoplanet that we realistically would be able to reach using a space probe he says.

The Apprehension of Shoplifters and Dishonest Employees Has Increased in of the Past Years According to Jack L. Hayes Internationals th Annual Retail Theft Survey
Click here to view a downloadableprintable PDF version of the survey including some of our thoughts behind the numbers.
Wesley Chapel FL Over . million shoplifters and dishonest employees were apprehended in by just large retailers who recovered over million from these thieves according to the th Annual Retail Theft Survey conducted by Jack L. Hayes International the leading loss prevention and inventory shrinkage control consulting firm.
Retail theft by both shoplifters and employees continues to plague the retail industry. Our latest Annual Retail Theft Survey th reflects an increase in both shoplifter and dishonest employee apprehensions . and . respectively in . Overall recoveries from those apprehensions totaled over million and was up . said Mark R. Doyle President of Jack L. Hayes International. It should be noted that the apprehension of shoplifters and dishonest employees has increased in of the last years Mr. Doyle added Retail theft causes consumers to pay higher prices for goods and is having a detrimental effect on retailers bottomline profits.
Jack L. Hayes International Inc. has been in the Loss PreventionShrinkage Control consulting business for over years and is recognized on an international level as the foremost loss prevention and inventory shrinkage control consulting firm in the world.
To further evaluate the severity of employee theft Hayes International analyzed over randomly selected Applicant Review questionnaires preemployment honesty tests given by CertiFinder to retail job applicants nationwide.
Previous theft admissions for the group of high risk job applicants totaled or . per applicant while the admissions for the group of low risk job applicants totaled or . per applicant. It is generally estimated the correct dollar amount for stolen money and merchandise is approximately times the admitted amount. Therefore based upon admissions made on The Applicant Review questionnaire the average high risk job applicant was responsible for the theft of . compared to . for the average low risk job applicant.

Poor preemployment screening and a decline in supervision are contributing to the rise in employee theft incidents new research shows.
A study of large retail companies by lossprevention consulting firm Jack L. Hayes International shows that dishonest employees were apprehended in up . percent from . In total more than million was recovered in those cases up percent from a year earlier.
The seriousness of retail theft is a much greater problem than many people realize said Mark Doyle president of Jack L. Hayes International. These theft losses are stealing profits from retailers and driving retail prices higher for the consumer.
Though the research didnt provide exact numbers in general more recently hired employees those with less than a year on the job and parttime employees with no vested interest in the company are the employees who tend to be apprehended more frequently Doyle said.
Customer service is still the best deterrent to theft so businesses need to hire honest motivated and outgoing employees Doyle told BusinessNewsDaily. Then adequately train these employees with lossprevention training and awareness programs as they are the first line of defense on the sales floor.
Employees arent the only ones increasing their illegal activity. The research shows that about . million shoplifters were apprehended in up . percent from . In those cases more than million was recovered a . percent increase from the year earlier.
I dont see anything in the immediate future that will substantially curb the theft epidemic he said. For every prevention technique we put in place thieves work very hard to circumvent it.
The study was based on data from large retail companies with stores and more than billion in retail sales.

If you used your credit or debit card for holiday shopping between November and December this year at Target the billionayear revenues retailing giant that big red bullseye is now painted on your checking or revolving credit account.
Although its unlikely that victims will be liable for any losses related to theft of funds from their accounts related to this incidentthanks to federal and industry consumer protections and liability limitsyou should take steps now to avoid the hassles associated with identity theft.
Crooks gained unauthorized access to credit and debit card payment data including the cardholders name account number expiration date and the threedigit CVV security code on the back of the card Target announced today. The retailers press release didnt indicate how many consumer were exposed but given that the theft took place at the height of the holiday shopping season millions are likely affected. We could not reach Targets press office whose phones kept hanging up while ringing or shortly after the options menu answered.
As we reported last February a whopping . percent of consumers who received notice of a security breach like the one that occurred at Target subsequently became victims of identity theft according to a survey of consumers by Javelin Strategy and Research a California consulting firm that has studied this crime for more than years.
Thats almost eight times the . percent ID fraud rate for consumers who hadnt received a breach notice. So you should take this threat seriously rather than ignore it which is the typical consumer reaction.
Dont get fleeced by identity theft proptection services either. Learn how they try to exploit your fear and how you can protect yourself for a low less in our reportDont get taken guarding your ID.
However while the Target security breach will be top of the news today theres no need for you to panic. Federal consumer protection laws and voluntary lending industry practices generally protect you from significantor anyoutofpocket dollar losses.
So the biggest threat to consumers is the hassle of monitoring your accounts for fraud reporting any theft and replacing compromised payment cards.

District Judge Timothy M. Dougherty waived a preliminary hearing this morning on charges he stole more than from a volunteer fire company organization and his court office in West Reading.
TALLAHASSEE Fla.Attorney General Pam Bondi today announced the arrests of five MiamiDade County residents in connection to an organized cargo theft ring. The arrests are the result of an investigation by Attorney General Bondis Office of Statewide Prosecution with the assistance of the MiamiDade Police Department Miami Metropolitan Major Theft Task Force and the Florida Highway Patrol Commercial Vehicle and Cargo Theft Task Force.
According to the investigation the defendants typically traveled from MiamiDade County in a rental vehicle to search for tractor trailers they could easily steal. Once the defendants stole both the cargo and trailers they returned to Miami to sell the stolen property on the black market. 
The five members of this theft ring face charges related to seven different cargo theft incidents in Broward Duval Hillsborough Orange Palm Beach and Polk Counties. The estimated loss of stolen property amounts to more than a million dollars.

According to Shaw and Mills Skypeck began working with the client in in his capacity as a statelicensed brokerdealer agent and insurance producer. He advised the client about her retirement investments held mostly in annuities.
Skypeck provided misleading information to the client about her annuity contracts in an effort to get her to exchange old policies for new ones.
The client followed Skypecks recommendations which resulted in unnecessary penalties and restricted her access to her money. With each new purchase Skypeck earned a commission.
Skypeck also instructed the client to withdraw almost from one of her annuities and then used most of that money to buy gold and silver coins.
The client later sold these coins and at Skypecks recommendation used the proceeds to buy almost from another precious metal dealer completing that transaction using his wifes name and forging her signature on the related documents. He received a commission for the coin sales as well and the client incurred a penalty for the withdrawal of the funds.
After having the coins delivered to the clients home Skypeck took one box of coins claiming that he would have them stored securely at a depository. When the client repeatedly inquired about the status of her coins over several months he gave a variety of excuses as to why they were unavailable including that he had stored them at his lake house which was inaccessible due to winter weather.
Skypeck later admitted that the coins were stored in his basement and that he had sold more than worth of the coins to cover personal expenses.
Skypeck is no longer licensed with the state Office of Securities as a brokerdealer agent and in a consent agreement executed in June of last year with the Bureau of Insurance he agreed to give up his insurance license.
The bureau worked with the companies that issued the clients annuities to recover in early surrender charges on her behalf. Skypeck also agreed to pay a civil penalty as part of the consent agreement which has been paid in the form of restitution.

The Apprehension of Shoplifters and Dishonest Employees Has Increased in of the Past Years According to Jack L. Hayes Internationals th Annual Retail Theft Survey
Click here to view a downloadableprintable PDF version of the survey including some of our thoughts behind the numbers.
Wesley Chapel FL Over . million shoplifters and dishonest employees were apprehended in by just large retailers who recovered over million from these thieves according to the th Annual Retail Theft Survey conducted by Jack L. Hayes International the leading loss prevention and inventory shrinkage control consulting firm.
Retail theft by both shoplifters and employees continues to plague the retail industry. Our latest Annual Retail Theft Survey th reflects an increase in both shoplifter and dishonest employee apprehensions . and . respectively in . Overall recoveries from those apprehensions totaled over million and was up . said Mark R. Doyle President of Jack L. Hayes International. It should be noted that the apprehension of shoplifters and dishonest employees has increased in of the last years Mr. Doyle added Retail theft causes consumers to pay higher prices for goods and is having a detrimental effect on retailers bottomline profits.
Jack L. Hayes International Inc. has been in the Loss PreventionShrinkage Control consulting business for over years and is recognized on an international level as the foremost loss prevention and inventory shrinkage control consulting firm in the world.
To further evaluate the severity of employee theft Hayes International analyzed over randomly selected Applicant Review questionnaires preemployment honesty tests given by CertiFinder to retail job applicants nationwide.
Previous theft admissions for the group of high risk job applicants totaled or . per applicant while the admissions for the group of low risk job applicants totaled or . per applicant. It is generally estimated the correct dollar amount for stolen money and merchandise is approximately times the admitted amount. Therefore based upon admissions made on The Applicant Review questionnaire the average high risk job applicant was responsible for the theft of . compared to . for the average low risk job applicant.
Poor preemployment screening and a decline in supervision are contributing to the rise in employee theft incidents new research shows.
A study of large retail companies by lossprevention consulting firm Jack L. Hayes International shows that dishonest employees were apprehended in up . percent from . In total more than million was recovered in those cases up percent from a year earlier.
The seriousness of retail theft is a much greater problem than many people realize said Mark Doyle president of Jack L. Hayes International. These theft losses are stealing profits from retailers and driving retail prices higher for the consumer.
Though the research didnt provide exact numbers in general more recently hired employees those with less than a year on the job and parttime employees with no vested interest in the company are the employees who tend to be apprehended more frequently Doyle said.
Customer service is still the best deterrent to theft so businesses need to hire honest motivated and outgoing employees Doyle told BusinessNewsDaily. Then adequately train these employees with lossprevention training and awareness programs as they are the first line of defense on the sales floor.
Employees arent the only ones increasing their illegal activity. The research shows that about . million shoplifters were apprehended in up . percent from . In those cases more than million was recovered a . percent increase from the year earlier.
I dont see anything in the immediate future that will substantially curb the theft epidemic he said. For every prevention technique we put in place thieves work very hard to circumvent it.
The study was based on data from large retail companies with stores and more than billion in retail sales.

Art Theft Antiquities Looting and Cultural Property Protection. This blog discusses recent news related to art theft and adds insight into the historical trends in the field of art crime.
On any given day throughout the school year thousands of students bustle in and out of Notre Dames South and North Dining Halls. They roam around while holding large beige trays passing by the spicy cucumber salad the glutenfree quinoa and the makeyourown pizza. They can eat as much or as little as they desire while inside the warm towering walls of these halls. But the rules change as they make their way out the door.
Notre Dame Food Services is engaged in an increasingly difficult and costly battle against theft of food and property from the dining halls. Ada Bradley a Notre Dame employee from until her death in said that monitors patrol the dining halls to help prevent this loss of food and property. She said I have seen students try to steal anything from waffle irons to chairs to just lots of excess foods.
Another monitor Janet Presnell advised This theft from the dining halls is just like any shoplifting but students dont think of it that way. Some students treat theft from the dining halls particularly of food as if it is not prohibited as if they have the right to smuggle out an entire loaf of wholewheat bread.
It seems that the posting of signs stating which five items are acceptable and the presence of monitors have only created an intriguing challenge for students.
Marc Poklinkowski the general manager of South Dining Hall thinks the extravagance of the items being taken has increased. He said Three students were starting to disassemble the frozen drink machine in the east dining room one day during lunch. They stopped and left when they realized we knew what they were up to.
Though the problem of dining hall property theft is not unique to Notre Dame the particular school pride and spirit at this University seem to play an important role. Poklinkowski said that items bearing the ND logo are far more popular for thieves than other items.
Weve eliminated ND waffle irons at South because of theft. The commercial grade waffle irons that were supplied by our waffle mix distributor cost about each. After they lost a few they wanted us to provide a solution to help from losing more. We started locking them down with padlocks and chains. Students cut the padlocks off to steal the irons so we just stopped the ND logo plates completely he said. The same holds true with the dining hall trays. We lost trays in just one year so when it came time to replace the trays we eliminated the logo.
Even items not associated with food are not safe from students sticky fingers. After the last football game we had a podium that the monitors use up at the front desk stolen probably because it had an ND on it Poklinkowski said.
Bradley said some of the nicer decorations like ice sculptures have become a problem. The staff puts up fewer decorations for holidays or special events each year because the administration could wind up losing them if theyre too attractive.
Poklinkowski said the failure of theft prevention measures has caused Food Services to make changes to menu items as well. He said One of our most popular desserts in the past was mousse in wine glasses. We used to serve this at candlelight dinners by borrowing the glasses from our catering department. We kept returning fewer and fewer glasses to them after each game and eventually they didnt have enough to supply both dining halls. It became so cost prohibitive that we just removed the item from our menus.
A missing wine glass or two doesnt sound like a financial fiasco but over the course of a year the numbers add up. Poklinkowski said The replacement cost for our small wares is about a year. Thats total replacement cost and does not separate any breakage general wear and tear etc. I would estimate that theft is probably responsible for over half of that.
Although there is an allotted budget for issues such as the cost of theft students could begin to see effects on their own wallets. Presnell said Eventually the theft will probably affect meal plan costs. If it costs more to feed you well charge you for it.
The replacement costs add up for students whose belongings are stolen too. Poklinkowski said Particularly at the end of each semester students property is stolen from the bookshelves in the lobby probably because the books can be sold back to the bookstore.
There is also a cost involved in the punishment for students caught stealing by the monitors. Bradley said We remove their student ID management puts it in the computer and the student has to pay a fee to get it back.
Students should be grateful that the punishment has changed over the past several decades. According to Notre Dame Archives in the rule was for unbecoming conduct in the University dining hall for taking silverware or other articles therefrom the penalty for the first offense is suspension and for the second offense dismissal.
The members of Food Services were quick to point out that only a small group of the Notre Dame students participate in this theft. Poklinkowski said When you have over students on meal plans there will be a few that will look to take advantage of the freedom that we supply in the dining halls.
Presnell maintains percent of the students are good. If they werent mostly good I wouldnt work here.

If you used your credit or debit card for holiday shopping between November and December this year at Target the billionayear revenues retailing giant that big red bullseye is now painted on your checking or revolving credit account.
Although its unlikely that victims will be liable for any losses related to theft of funds from their accounts related to this incidentthanks to federal and industry consumer protections and liability limitsyou should take steps now to avoid the hassles associated with identity theft.
Crooks gained unauthorized access to credit and debit card payment data including the cardholders name account number expiration date and the threedigit CVV security code on the back of the card Target announced today. The retailers press release didnt indicate how many consumer were exposed but given that the theft took place at the height of the holiday shopping season millions are likely affected. We could not reach Targets press office whose phones kept hanging up while ringing or shortly after the options menu answered.
As we reported last February a whopping . percent of consumers who received notice of a security breach like the one that occurred at Target subsequently became victims of identity theft according to a survey of consumers by Javelin Strategy and Research a California consulting firm that has studied this crime for more than years.
Thats almost eight times the . percent ID fraud rate for consumers who hadnt received a breach notice. So you should take this threat seriously rather than ignore it which is the typical consumer reaction.
Dont get fleeced by identity theft proptection services either. Learn how they try to exploit your fear and how you can protect yourself for a low less in our reportDont get taken guarding your ID.
However while the Target security breach will be top of the news today theres no need for you to panic. Federal consumer protection laws and voluntary lending industry practices generally protect you from significantor anyoutofpocket dollar losses.
So the biggest threat to consumers is the hassle of monitoring your accounts for fraud reporting any theft and replacing compromised payment cards.

A recent report from the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety shows the model EXT luxury pickup and the model midsize sedan have the highest theft claim rates among newer passenger vehicles. The Escalade and Maxima have theft claim rates to times the average for all cars based on the latest insurance theft loss results for passenger vehicles one to three years old as published by the Highway Loss Data Institute HLDI an affiliate of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 
This is the second year in a row that an Escalade is among the vehicles most likely to have a theft claim says Kim Hazelbaker HLDI senior vice president. Both the Escalade pickup and SUV also top the list of vehicles with the most expensive theft claims indicating they are top targets for thieves.
The Escalades theft losses are the highest even though this vehicle is equipped with a standard antitheft ignition immobilizer. An immobilizer is built into a vehicles electronic ignition system and is supposed to prevent the vehicle from being started without the proper key.
The Escalades antitheft immobilizer system is an early version that may not be as effective as the systems in other vehicles. The Insurance Bureau of Canada doesnt certify the Escalades immobilizer as meeting the Bureaus antitheft standard because thieves may have found a way to defeat it. Such immobilizers also dont meet antitheft requirements in many other countries.
Investigators tell us the highintensity discharge headlights are often stolen because they fit into earlier Maximas that were sold without such lights Hazelbaker says. This car was redesigned for and its new headlight assemblies dont fit previous generation models. Its too early to tell if the s will still have a theft problem.
HLDI results are the only reported theft results based on the number of insured vehicles. Information on theft losses published by the National Insurance Crime Bureau and CCC Information Services doesnt take into account how many of each vehicle are insured so the most popular vehicles on the road tend to top these organizations lists of moststolen vehicles. In contrast HLDI identifies vehicles with the worst theft losses by counting the number of claims by make and model relative to the number of each make and model insured indicating which vehicles are most likely to be targets.
Since overall theft claim frequencies have declined while average insurance payments per theft claim have increased. But these trends have leveled off in recent years.

Medical identity theft is on the rise and hasnt shown signs of slowing down anytime soon according to a new report released Thursday.
Conducted by privacy and security research firm Ponemon Institute the report underscores the serious nature of medical identity theft which has seen a nearly percent uptick in the number of victims just from last year alone.
Some . million people in the U.S. are currently affected by medical identity theft with these victims handing over more than billion in outofpocket costs and paying on average per individual according to survey findings.
One of the more serious aspects of medical identity theft unlike traditional financial identity theft crime is that in the extreme this could lead to your death said Ponemon Chairman and Founder Larry Ponemon in an interview with Healthcare IT News. Because your medical file could change on blood type on allergy on previous procedures.
Medical identity theft victims surveyed experienced a misdiagnosis percent of respondents mistreatment percent of respondents delay in treatment percent of respondents or were prescribed the wrong pharmaceuticals percent of respondents. However many respondents reported doing nothing to resolve the incident.
Findings also show some percent of consumers who dont take action to protect their health information. Fiftyfour percent of consumers fail to check their health records because they dont know how and they trust their healthcare providers to be accurate. Likewise percent of respondents do not check their Explanation of Benefits. Of those who found unfamiliar claims percent did not report them.
People just arent aware of how serious and lifethreatening medical identity can be Ponemon explained. And with the nearly percent increase in medical identity theft cases its certainly a cause for concern.
A health record is actually viewed as much more valuable than almost every other category because a health record in the extreme contains very important information like your physical characteristics of course your health insurance but also payment information said Ponemon. Thats all contained in the one file making the crime all the more enticing for criminals.
The survey also finds that consumers often put themselves at risk by sharing their medical identification with family members or friends unintentionally committing family fraud to obtain medical services or treatment healthcare products or pharmaceuticals.

Retail Security Survey Shows U.S. Retailers Losing Billion to Theft 
Inventory shrinkage a combination of employee theft shoplifting vendor fraud and administrative error cost United States retailers over billion last year according to the latest National Retail Security Survey report on retail theft which analyzed theft incidents from of the largest U.S. retail chains. 
According to University of Florida criminologist Richard C. Hollinger Ph.D. who directs the National Retail Security Survey retailers lost . percent of their total annual sales to inventory shrinkage last year. The surveyed portion of the retail economy transacts over . trillion dollars annually making the loss worth over . billion. Total inventory shrinkage was down slightly from . billion in . 
While total inventory shrinkage was down slightly last year to . percent from . percent two years ago both employee theft and shoplifting are on the rise. Inventory shrinkage remains the single largest category of larceny in the United States more than motor vehicle theft bank robbery and household burglary combined. 
Hollinger warns that it isnt just retailers who should be concerned about retail theft. Retail theft impacts everyone. Ultimately its consumers that are hurt the most in the form of higher prices. 
An average family of four will spend more than this year in higher prices because of inventory theft Hollinger said. Thieves also generally target hot selling items which means those musthave toys on your childs holiday wish list are less likely to be available on the store shelves. 
The study conducted by the University of Florida with a funding grant from ADT Security Services Inc. a unit of Tyco Fire and Security Services discovered that retail security managers attributed more than . percent of their losses to employee theft up from percent the prior year. Internal theft by employees cost retailers a record billion. 
Shoplifting was also on the rise last year with . percent of retail losses resulting from shoplifting compared to . percent two years ago. Shoplifting was responsible for nearly billion in losses last year. Employee theft and shoplifting combined continue to account for the largest source of property crime committed annually in the United States. 
The remainder of the annual retail losses not due to employee theft and shoplifting are caused by paperwork errors and theft by vendors. Both administrative errors and vendor fraud have declined from two years ago. 
The holiday shopping season is really a make or break season for many retailers. It is also an extremely busy time which leaves stores more vulnerable to theft said Mike Snyder president of ADT Security Services. Many retailers are using security technologies such as antishoplifting digital video and pointofsale systems to help their staff zero in on theft problems. 
Pointofsale data mining software solutions that detect potential theft problems at the cash register and alert appropriate personnel in realtime. These data mining packages can be tied to digital video recorders to provide crisp clear images of who sold what to whom with a click of a button and can delivered to any location around the world. 
Source tagging programs where tiny antitheft labels about the size of a paper clip are placed inside an actual product or product package effectively hiding it from view. 
Selfalarming antitheft tags that broadcast an audible alarm throughout the store when a shoplifter attempts to improperly remove it from merchandise. Stores that utilize security technologies generally have lower overall inventory shrinkage than those retailers who do not Snyder said. Technology also allows employees to focus more time on assisting customers and less on patrolling the aisles. 
Technology alone will not eliminate retail theft. Retailers who want to reduce losses should also strive to provide good customer service and promote high job satisfaction levels among its retail sales associates. 
Ernst Youngs Study of Retail Loss Prevention examines how retailers manage one of their most significant costs inventory shrinkage which includes employee theft shoplifting administrative and paperwork errors and vendor errorsissues. In addition to the financial impact of shrink the survey provides new insight on the effectiveness of the programs and tools employed by retailers to combat it. The study estimates that the U.S. retail industry loses a staggering billion annually to inventory shrinkage and that employee theft delivers the heaviest blow in terms of dollars lost. 
Companies are placing a renewed emphasis on managing shrink to help improve profitability in this difficult economic environment said Jay McIntosh Americas Director Retail and Consumer Products Ernst Young Based on the results of our survey which indicate a median loss of . percent or million per participant translating to an industrywide loss of billion annually the profit at risk most certainly justifies this renewed focus. 
According to the study employee theft is the single biggest contributor to inventory shrinkage even though shoplifters far outpace dishonest employees. This is because the dollar value of employee theft on a per incident basis is much higher than that of shoplifting said McIntosh. But according to our study apprehensions of shoplifters far outpace apprehensions of employees. Though employees accounted for only out of every apprehensions the average value of merchandise recovered was nearly seven times that of the average shoplifter and respectively. 
These numbers should raise a red flag for retailers. If as our study indicates percent of dollars lost to shrinkage are attributable to employee theft there should be less satisfaction with the ability to catch shoplifters and more emphasis on efforts to identify and deter inhouse theft said McIntosh. 
The average study respondent spends more than million a year on loss prevention. However less than half the study respondents percent reported a decrease in shrink over the previous year while percent reported an increase and percent said shrinkage was consistent. Respondents said they use a dozen different employee awareness programs including hotlines codes of conduct and incentive compensation programs to try to address employee theft but the problem is likely the way these programs are deployed. Simply having programs and procedures in place or announcing them to employees isnt enough. To maximize ROI companies must follow up by enforcing the policies visibly and directly. 
A company can employ a dozen or a thousand programs to deter theft but if the discrepancies are simply being overlooked then the problem clearly has roots in management and not procedure said McIntosh. We believe that whats needed is a combination of analytics to better identify deviations better instore procedures such as cycle counts of inventory and stronger corporate policies to enforce antitheft programs. 
As capital markets continue to punish companies for poor performance and earnings surprises substandard shrinkage reduction efforts pose a serious risk to retailers. An analytical approach can provide a valuable understanding of the causes of shrink and help retailers develop loss prevention measures that more effectively address their issues. Transactional systems such as Point of Sale POS systems have both increased the amount of data available to retailers and decreased the cost of collecting it. 
While rules of thumb or intuition have been employed in the past to make loss prevention investment decisions todays environment demands a more rigorous approach said McIntosh. By using sophisticated analytics retailers can make better loss prevention decisions. Just a relatively small improvement can have a significant impact on a retailers bottom line. 
The companies that participated in the Ernst Young study which was conducted in include of the largest and most successful American retailers operating a mean of stores with mean revenues of approximately . billion. The average shrinkage loss at retail incurred by each respondent was . percent or approximately million annually. 
The reliability of the information contained in this report depends on the quality of the information provided by the respondents to the survey. The number and type of retailers who responded also affect the trends outlined. Some trends might therefore not be representative of a particular segment or of the retail industry as a whole.

An average family of four will spend more than this year in higher prices because of inventory theft Hollinger said. Thieves also generally target hot selling items which means those musthave toys on your childs holiday wish list are less likely to be available on the store shelves. 
The study conducted by the University of Florida with a funding grant from ADT Security Services Inc. a unit of Tyco Fire and Security Services discovered that retail security managers attributed more than . percent of their losses to employee theft up from percent the prior year. Internal theft by employees cost retailers a record billion. 
Shoplifting was also on the rise last year with . percent of retail losses resulting from shoplifting compared to . percent two years ago. Shoplifting was responsible for nearly billion in losses last year. Employee theft and shoplifting combined continue to account for the largest source of property crime committed annually in the United States. 
The remainder of the annual retail losses not due to employee theft and shoplifting are caused by paperwork errors and theft by vendors. Both administrative errors and vendor fraud have declined from two years ago. 
The holiday shopping season is really a make or break season for many retailers. It is also an extremely busy time which leaves stores more vulnerable to theft said Mike Snyder president of ADT Security Services. Many retailers are using security technologies such as antishoplifting digital video and pointofsale systems to help their staff zero in on theft problems. 
Pointofsale data mining software solutions that detect potential theft problems at the cash register and alert appropriate personnel in realtime. These data mining packages can be tied to digital video recorders to provide crisp clear images of who sold what to whom with a click of a button and can delivered to any location around the world. 
Source tagging programs where tiny antitheft labels about the size of a paper clip are placed inside an actual product or product package effectively hiding it from view. 
Selfalarming antitheft tags that broadcast an audible alarm throughout the store when a shoplifter attempts to improperly remove it from merchandise. Stores that utilize security technologies generally have lower overall inventory shrinkage than those retailers who do not Snyder said. Technology also allows employees to focus more time on assisting customers and less on patrolling the aisles. 
Technology alone will not eliminate retail theft. Retailers who want to reduce losses should also strive to provide good customer service and promote high job satisfaction levels among its retail sales associates. 
Ernst Youngs Study of Retail Loss Prevention examines how retailers manage one of their most significant costs inventory shrinkage which includes employee theft shoplifting administrative and paperwork errors and vendor errorsissues. In addition to the financial impact of shrink the survey provides new insight on the effectiveness of the programs and tools employed by retailers to combat it. The study estimates that the U.S. retail industry loses a staggering billion annually to inventory shrinkage and that employee theft delivers the heaviest blow in terms of dollars lost. 
Companies are placing a renewed emphasis on managing shrink to help improve profitability in this difficult economic environment said Jay McIntosh Americas Director Retail and Consumer Products Ernst Young Based on the results of our survey which indicate a median loss of . percent or million per participant translating to an industrywide loss of billion annually the profit at risk most certainly justifies this renewed focus. 
According to the study employee theft is the single biggest contributor to inventory shrinkage even though shoplifters far outpace dishonest employees. This is because the dollar value of employee theft on a per incident basis is much higher than that of shoplifting said McIntosh. But according to our study apprehensions of shoplifters far outpace apprehensions of employees. Though employees accounted for only out of every apprehensions the average value of merchandise recovered was nearly seven times that of the average shoplifter and respectively. 
These numbers should raise a red flag for retailers. If as our study indicates percent of dollars lost to shrinkage are attributable to employee theft there should be less satisfaction with the ability to catch shoplifters and more emphasis on efforts to identify and deter inhouse theft said McIntosh. 
The average study respondent spends more than million a year on loss prevention. However less than half the study respondents percent reported a decrease in shrink over the previous year while percent reported an increase and percent said shrinkage was consistent. Respondents said they use a dozen different employee awareness programs including hotlines codes of conduct and incentive compensation programs to try to address employee theft but the problem is likely the way these programs are deployed. Simply having programs and procedures in place or announcing them to employees isnt enough. To maximize ROI companies must follow up by enforcing the policies visibly and directly. 
A company can employ a dozen or a thousand programs to deter theft but if the discrepancies are simply being overlooked then the problem clearly has roots in management and not procedure said McIntosh. We believe that whats needed is a combination of analytics to better identify deviations better instore procedures such as cycle counts of inventory and stronger corporate policies to enforce antitheft programs. 
As capital markets continue to punish companies for poor performance and earnings surprises substandard shrinkage reduction efforts pose a serious risk to retailers. An analytical approach can provide a valuable understanding of the causes of shrink and help retailers develop loss prevention measures that more effectively address their issues. Transactional systems such as Point of Sale POS systems have both increased the amount of data available to retailers and decreased the cost of collecting it. 
While rules of thumb or intuition have been employed in the past to make loss prevention investment decisions todays environment demands a more rigorous approach said McIntosh. By using sophisticated analytics retailers can make better loss prevention decisions. Just a relatively small improvement can have a significant impact on a retailers bottom line. 
The companies that participated in the Ernst Young study which was conducted in include of the largest and most successful American retailers operating a mean of stores with mean revenues of approximately . billion. The average shrinkage loss at retail incurred by each respondent was . percent or approximately million annually. 
The reliability of the information contained in this report depends on the quality of the information provided by the respondents to the survey. The number and type of retailers who responded also affect the trends outlined. Some trends might therefore not be representative of a particular segment or of the retail industry as a whole. 
Medical identity theft is on the rise and hasnt shown signs of slowing down anytime soon according to a new report released Thursday.
Conducted by privacy and security research firm Ponemon Institute the report underscores the serious nature of medical identity theft which has seen a nearly percent uptick in the number of victims just from last year alone.
Some . million people in the U.S. are currently affected by medical identity theft with these victims handing over more than billion in outofpocket costs and paying on average per individual according to survey findings.
One of the more serious aspects of medical identity theft unlike traditional financial identity theft crime is that in the extreme this could lead to your death said Ponemon Chairman and Founder Larry Ponemon in an interview with Healthcare IT News. Because your medical file could change on blood type on allergy on previous procedures.
Medical identity theft victims surveyed experienced a misdiagnosis percent of respondents mistreatment percent of respondents delay in treatment percent of respondents or were prescribed the wrong pharmaceuticals percent of respondents. However many respondents reported doing nothing to resolve the incident.
Findings also show some percent of consumers who dont take action to protect their health information. Fiftyfour percent of consumers fail to check their health records because they dont know how and they trust their healthcare providers to be accurate. Likewise percent of respondents do not check their Explanation of Benefits. Of those who found unfamiliar claims percent did not report them.
People just arent aware of how serious and lifethreatening medical identity can be Ponemon explained. And with the nearly percent increase in medical identity theft cases its certainly a cause for concern.
A health record is actually viewed as much more valuable than almost every other category because a health record in the extreme contains very important information like your physical characteristics of course your health insurance but also payment information said Ponemon. Thats all contained in the one file making the crime all the more enticing for criminals.
The survey also finds that consumers often put themselves at risk by sharing their medical identification with family members or friends unintentionally committing family fraud to obtain medical services or treatment healthcare products or pharmaceuticals.

A Nordstrom sales clerk accused of stealing nearly through false merchandise returns has pleaded not guilty to firstdegree theft.
The saleswoman began working at the Tacoma department store in June and it wasnt long before loss prevention officers began monitoring her. 
In a twomonth span she returned nine items worth to the same few credit cards according to charging papers. 
Prosecutors allege none of the returns had receipts and some items did not come from Nordstrom. One designer blazer had a price tag of and a Prada dress was valued at more than prosecutors said.
The sales clerk allegedly told police she was approached by a man who runs an organized retail theft ring and asked to participate. She said she was paid to per return.

At the start of a local police officer reported that his own identity had been stolen and used to obtain fraudulent unemployment benefits from the state.
That tip led federal agents to a Miami Gardens residence where they found lists with names birth dates and Social Security numbers stolen from more than people authorities say.
On Thursday the U.S. attorneys office spotlighted the arrests of Miami Gardens brothers Densom Beaucejour and Winzord Beaucejour among defendants recently charged to dramatize the spread of ID theftrelated crimes in South Florida.
The Beaucejours both in their early s were charged with conspiring to use stolen IDs for submitting bogus federal income tax returns. But that wasnt all. Theyre also accused of seeking false state tax refunds in Ohio and filing bogus unemployment claims in Florida.
U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer said that as investigators have begun targeting the persistent and pervasive threat of incometax fraud over the past three years the crooks have diversified into other criminal schemes even outside of Florida.
As the heat has been going up on stolen identitytax refund fraud the bad guys . still need to find other targets to use those stolen identities Ferrer told reporters at a press conference. The new crime du jour is unemployment insurance claims.
Ferrer also cited credit card debit card and Social Security fraud among the newer offenses charged in the latest takedown of ID theft offenders. His announcement was designed to heighten awareness of the spreading problems in the runup to the taxfiling deadline on April .
Collectively the various defendants used tens of thousands of stolen IDs to try to collect about million in tax refunds and other government benefits from the Treasury Department Florida and other states such as Ohio Michigan and Texas according to the U.S. attorneys office. Of that total . million was paid out most in IRSissued tax refunds but also in state unemployment benefits.
The force behind the fraud is still the same. For the past four years Florida has been ranked No. in the country for identity theft according to complaints compiled by the Federal Trade Commission. South Floridas IDtheft rate is twice that of the rest of the state.
Ferrer said stolen IDs are the new crack cocaine for these offenders who buy lists of names dates of birth and Social Security numbers from insiders at hospitals medical offices and schools among other places. Florida Georgia and the District of Columbia have emerged as national hot spots for ID theftrelated crimes especially taxrefund fraud.
It is frustrating and frightening to think that someone else has your personal identification said Kelly Jackson special agent in charge of the IRS criminal investigations noting the problem has spread from MiamiDade and Broward counties into Palm Beach County.
Beginning in IRS criminal investigators working with local and federal authorities began targeting the crime. But the numbers show it remains very much a growth industry.
Nationwide the IRS estimated it received million returns with stolen identities totaling . billion in fraudulent refund claims during the filing season according to the latest Gover
