A pro Palestinian activist who carry out an acid attack against an Israeli owned stall in Scotland has been sentenced to a year in jail Scott Harrison threw the noxious liquid at a woman who was manning a stall in Glasgow owned by the Israeli cosmetics firm Kedem which activists from the anti Israel BDS movement have been targeting in a boycott campaign His lawyers are filing an appeal against the month sentence for assault to injury which was handed down by a Scottish court earlier this week He is currently being held in custody pending the results of his appeal Harrison s year old victim Greek born Iona Georgianna told the Scottish Sun shortly after the attack on October how she felt her face melting I was working and then I felt liquid on my head she said describing the terrifying attack It started to burn It felt like my face was melting I was screaming I couldn t feel my lips and my vision was blurred for two or three minutes A quick thinking colleague poured five liters of water on her head saving her from the worst effects of the mystery liquid Although Kedem outlets throughout the United Kingdom had been targeted by aggressive and anti Semitic anti Israel boycotters in the past that particular attack came against the backdrop of a massive increase in anti Semitism spurred on by anti Israel groups during that summer s war between Israel and Gazan terrorist groups Speaking to the UK s Jewish Telegraph Glasgow Jewish Representative Council President Paul Morron who visited the stall shortly after the attack hailed the sentencing The Palestinian cause is not helped by vicious criminality which this case represents Morron said This is the most serious of a series of cases that have arisen from criminal action against Israeli owned stalls in the Glasgow area over the past months This case was particularly frightening The stall staff acted very quickly in bathing the victim s eyes with water but it was a very distressing experience for her It shows the dangers of anti Israel sentiment when it gets out of control I would like to thank the police and Procurator Fiscal service for their efficiency and professionalism 
Andreas Christopheros recalls seeing his baby son for the first time after being brutally attacked with acid on his doorstep Courtesy ITVAndreas had acid thrown on him by a complete stranger after a case of mistaken identity AN ACID attack victim who was assaulted on his doorstep in a case of mistaken identity has spoken out about his horror ordeal Andreas Christopheros had battery acid thrown at him by an attacker who thought he was someone else on December The father of one from Cornwall in the UK has now spoken out about the tragedy which left him worry his two year old son would think he was a monster Property developer Andreas suffered a permanent loss of vision and horrific burns Source Snapper MediaSpeaking on ITV s This Morning TV show Andreas said I opened the door as I would normally And one motion bang this is for you mate All in one motion There was not even time to blink it happened so suddenly Despite the sudden attack Andreas says he knew straight away he had been hit with acid as his T shirt completely dissolved Andreas feared his young son would think he was a monster Source Snapper MediaHe added The pain is inexplicable It s nothing like I ve ever felt before you can t even comprehend The year old screamed out to his wife Pia who was upstairs with their baby and ran to the kitchen and started dousing myself with as much water as I could because that was the only thing I knew to do Andreas and his baby son before the horror attack Source Snapper MediaPia whose socks disintegrated as she ran on the acid soaked carpet to call emergency services described her husband s screams as haunting Andreas fell into a coma for four days after arriving at hospital but says the last thing he remembers is giving as much information to ambulance workers as he possibly could to help police catch his attacker including details of a suspicious red van parked outside his house before the assault Andreas wouldn t let his young son see him for two monthsSource Snapper MediaThis information helped police catch David Phillips who has since been jailed for life Phillips had decided to take matters into his own hands after a member of his family was sexually assaulted by someone he wrongly believed to live at Andreas address The man drove km from his home in Sussex to carry out the vicious attack in revenge As he was sentenced he looked over at Andreas and said I am very sorry After being admitted to hospital the brave dad was eventually flown to a specialist burns unit in Swansea but days after his devastated mum and wife were told he probably wouldn t make it through the night after the attack It was two months before Andreas let his young son who was also admitted to hospital due to the strong fumes see him because of his injuries He said Luckily he s amazing My wife Pia brought him down and he looked at me and nestled into Pia s neck Then about two minutes later he just stuck his arms out for me and clung on to me and wouldn t let go It was the best feeling in the world Without him I don t know where I would be now He s just absolutely incredible 
Three Indian acid attack survivors confront the violence committed against them by writing letters to their attackers The first efforts at Shriners addressed Prerna s neck The skin grafts done in India lacked elasticity and prevented Prerna from turning her head Half a dozen medical procedures aimed to reduce the rigid scarring on her neck Then pediatric plastic surgeon Ann Schwentker joined Prerna s case Schwentker travels the world on medical mission trips but Prerna was her first acid attack survivor At their first appointment the doctor asked the patient what bothered her Prerna lifted her veil of dark hair to show the right side of her head where an ear used to be Then she pointed to the space above her right eye where a brow used to be To create an ear Schwentker took a piece of cartilage from one of Prerna s ribs The operation was successful but infection set in and the graft failed It was a big setback but Prerna handled it extremely well Schwentker said She s always looking forward Her response was How do we move on Schwentker promised that later she would build a prosthetic that would attach to Prerna s head with a post into the bone like a dental implant To fix Prerna s eyebrow Schwentker inserted a small balloon under Prerna s scalp The balloon slowly expanded the skin then Schwentker harvested a graft sliced it follicle by follicle then over four sessions constructed a new brow Head hair grows faster than brow hair so the new brow requires almost daily trimming No big deal Prerna said Shriners Hospital will care for Prerna until she is Schwentker also is using lasers to smooth the burn scars Eventually she wants Prerna to see an orthodontist because after the acid burned her lips her teeth splayed forward She has matured a lot just in the short time I ve known her Schwentker said She s older than her years She seems very quiet but she really has quite a voice She has the potential to make quite a big difference in the world The doctor said Prerna reminds her of Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousefzai the girl from the Swat Valley of Pakistan who survived a bullet to the head fired by a Taliban militant because she advocated education for girls After six months Prerna s mother returned to India For the subsequent appointments and procedures Heidi Hudson Flege sat with Prerna held her hand at night in the hospital She told Prerna that she is beautiful Prerna argued with her How can you say this 
India a country grappling with violence against women has one of the highest rates of acid attacks in the world about cases were officially reported in Their faces scarred most acid attack survivors virtually disappear from society But a cafe in the tourist hub of Agra Sheroes Hangout is helping them return to the mainstream by winning social acceptance for them Dolly Kumari never ventured out for two agonizing years after a man who was years older her senior chucked acid on her face for spurning his advances She says when she first came to the caf I had covered my face fully I did it in a way that even my eyes did not show But after serving and meeting customers for several months Dolly has regained confidence and has vowed never to hide behind a dupatta a piece of cloth worn around the neck in South Asia She wants to return to her studies I have so much courage I can say anything to anyone I too have a life Dolly says New Delhi based nongovernmental group Stop Acid Attacks that works with acid attack survivors launched the cafe a year ago after making little headway in getting jobs and rehabilitating victims like Dolly Most of the women are attacked over domestic or property disputes or for rejecting sexual advances or marriage proposals Alok Dixit founding member of the group says families and neighborhoods worsen the plight of the women with attitudes that compel them to become virtually invisible Dixit says the isolation forced on them unwittingly by society is perhaps even more painful than the agony they suffered at the time of the attack At Sheroes he hopes to change the perception that a disfigured face spells ruin This is the notion we want to break Your face is not all You cannot ruin a victim s life by ruining their face Life is beyond how you look he says The caf is an effort to spread that message softly not through sloganeering and protests but by bringing victims face to face with the public They gain confidence through interacting with the nearly cafe customers many who have visited after hearing about it through social media Social acceptance has given a renewed sense of purpose to Rupa whose stepmother threw acid on her in After the attack she hid herself in the house But after working at the caf she said she is nurturing dreams of becoming a fashion designer clothes she designs are displayed at the caf People come to meet us they want to know our story they sit and talk to us At one time we were alone even within our families now society reaches out to us she says To draw in people from all strata of society the menu at the cafe does not set a price letting customers pay what they want There are no official figures for acid attacks in India but it is estimated there could be a year in a country where acid is easily available despite laws implemented in to regulate its over the counter sale Seventy percent of the acid attacks target women and most are against those between ages to Laws to punish offenders have been made tougher but it is unclear if that has helped stem acid attacks What is clear is that the veil is slowly being lifted from a crime whose horrific implications few saw earlier because victims went into hiding Neetu Mahour encountered the world at the caf for the first time since she was years old when she was nearly blinded in an acid attack by her father He also targeted her infant sister and her mother The infant die and now Neetu and her mother work at the caf Neetu never went to school or played with other children People considered us different no one spoke to us or invited us Now she says life is better in every way whether it is money the way she dresses eats or lives People she says no longer make comments when she passes by The women are encouraged to be proud of the way they look their faces and stories are plastered on the walls We want to redefine beauty Dixit says The heartening response to Sheroes has encouraged Stop Acid Attacks to plan three more ventures in New Delhi Lucknow and Udaipur It is a small but inspirational step in a country that is stepping up the fight to tackle violence against women It took three years for Rupa to look at her face in the mirror following a horrifying acid attack by her own stepmother 
A pair of bills passed by Pakistan s parliament today have made it illegal to throw acid on women or force them into prostitution Progress Angela Paterson of Indianapolis has been arrested and charged with aggravated battery after she reportedly threw a bottle of acid at her son s girlfriend s face causing severe burns and blisters Just days after Bethany Storro was attacked in a similar fashion by an unidentify woman in Vancouver Derri Velarde of Mesa Arizona is now recovering after having acid thrown at her face by another woman while walking to her car Another day another story about the dangers of being born female Last night Australia s ABC network ran a segment about the horrible reality of acid violence in Bangladesh It is as our tipster described it amazing terrible inspiring In yesterday s Week in Review section of the NY Times Anand Giriharadas tackled last week s terrorist attacks in Mumbai and the personal turn they took A few pages later Op Ed columnist Nick Kristof inveighed against another type of personal terrorism that committed against the large numbers of Pakistani and Acid attacks or vitriolage we are made aware of them via the media on a regular basis The effect of acid on human flesh is horrific to say the least The images most of us associate with the term acid attack are that of disfigured and deformed woman with horrendous scars where the acid has come into contact with their flesh The effects if the acid in the attack is strong enough or not neutralized quickly are permanent Acid attacks are not new In point of fact women have a rich history of using acid in their attacks Our resident historian Robert St Estephe has documented a substantial list going back to when Margaret Boyle of Philadelphia Pennsylvania threw acid in the face of her son in law as he was not the man she had chose for her daughter It was the patriarchy matriarchy that forced Mrs Boyle to commit her crime right And over at E Belfort Bax website we can find it referenced as well The term used for acid by Bax was vitriol Used primarily by women in his day Most of the news fed to us about this particularly heinous form of violence covers about of the story today about of the victims are men The feminist organizations feed it to the news groups and they in turn don t bother checking the facts Feminists never blatantly lie about gender violence right Now since we know feminists don t like admitting male victims exist It falls upon us to bring to the public s attention the other approximate of the victims The reasons for these attacks are not really all that important for this article The reasons are never satisfactory unless a person s life is in immediate danger They have no safe escape and that is the only tool they have to defend themselves Beyond that I don t care if your honour has been insulted you were jilted by your spouse lover or whatever reasons a person may try and use to justify engaging in this crime ITS WRONG no further discussion needed Wrong if it happens to a woman and wrong if it happens to a man 
But our moral betters don t seem to want to be as bold with their stand against these crimes as you and I are They have force fed society the same old lie of only female victims Maybe an odd male child but other than that the male victims are kept out of society s view Its just the way feminism likes it so they can fill their coffers with donations and government grants for telling just over half the story However recently I stumbled across this article and found this quote Forty percent of the acid attack victims in Pakistan are men or boys I try to track this number down but unfortunately the best I could find other than the quote from Sharon Behn is numbers from the Acid Survivors Foundation 
The numbers for the year for acid attacks are incidents of acid being used as a weapon and victims 
Using a global population number of billion the average person has a chance of of being a victim of one of the most vicious and heinous crimes know to humankind 
This crime is incredibly rare and for that I am glad I wouldn t wish this on the worst of the rad fems 
On page of their statistics tab we they break down the numbers for us men women and children were attacked with acid in 
The report does not state whether the children were intended or unintended victims injured from being with the adults Assuming the children were unintended victims the total number of adults for is Which means that or about of those acid attack victims were men 
On another acid survivors website from Cambodia they have numbers from There numbers show that of the adult victims were adult males were adult females were male children under the age of and were females under the age of Despite about of the acid attack victims being male acid survivors foundation true to feminist form states 
Acid violence is a form of gender based violence that reflects and perpetuates the inequality of women in society And helping that lie spread was boosted by COMBATING ACID VIOLENCE IN BANGLADESH INDIA AND CAMBODIA I call BULLSHIT There is a about a difference between the sexes in acid attacks That is not gender based violence Even if we include the children the percentage of men only drops down to just over that is still not gender based violence 
Woman pours acid on ex boyfriend at taxi rankThis article has potential to talk about an issue from a new perspective but where it fails is making it seem like feminism is a bigger problem than the acid attacks themselves I m not a feminist or a woman for that matter but I AM an emergency relief worker who cares about strict and thorough journalism I thought that this article was going to be impartial and facts based but it goes off on tangents that lead the reader to believe that the author has an agenda instead of being non biased journalism The problem is the acid attacks Period They are horrible And people NEED to understand that men are victims too And if certain feminist groups don t want to give all the facts that isn t right But the author s opinions are irrelevant to the big picture Feminists though potentially not giving all the facts are not the problem they are not the CAUSE of acid attacks And making it seem like they are the biggest problem in this story is wrong people who THROW ACID are the problem Why are they not the focus of this story Why are they not the villains of this story Maybe that s not what Dan Perrins meant to do but it s how it came off It attacked the wrong group I have worked in Colombia with acid attack survivors and the whole thing is shocking and horrible and so so sad I m glad that this other side is being shared But in order to be the most effective it should be more impartial Otherwise you risk people completely disregarding an urgent and horrifying human rights atrocity because they don t trust the author who is inserting his own ideas into something that is bigger than him Some of us may agree with his opinions but this kind of an important story is NO place for them There s a reason why opinion pieces are in a separate section of the newspapers Focus on the acid attacks Not the feminists The feminists may be biased but in order to fight that you must be a voice of reason that bares the REAL facts without adding in opinion THAT S how you stand out in a truly effective and legitimate way Bravo for pointing out a new side to acid attacks but please please please don t alienate readers This issue is so so important It needs all the support it can get And even though I want people to understand that men are victims too I could never share this article because it would upset too many people for the WRONG reasons Please Dan is there a way that you could rewrite this article in a more impartial way so that I can share it as a news article and not an op ed Thank you 
Acid attacks cause great harm to a tiny segment of the population feminism protects females who commit this crime and plenty of other crimes by hiding their numbers This article attacks the right group feminists who lie about the nature of acid attacks 
You must be new here we publish a LOT of opinion pieces and our willingness to alienate readers is legendary However if you follow and read the links in the article you ll find plenty of impartial data Also feel free to write and submit the article you want to see we are a tiny understaffed volunteer organization and we welcome contributions just not contributions with a gynocentric slant 
Ah I see Well at least you admit that you are biased Yes I don t think this is the site for me Although it does hit a nerve that you say that the issue of acid attacks is less important just because it affects fewer people I m sorry but the brutal maiming and often killing of victims is worse than some babbling feminazis who hide facts You have clearly not been firsthand involved with this issue and seen up front the devastating effects And not to be rude but what have you done to contribute to the issue of acid attacks Probably less than the people you verbally attack on this site Feminist groups may be biased but they do actual concrete work in this area I worked with many different groups and some were feminist organizations They do more than talk They take action Do you I know I do You seem to just skip over the fact that these organizations actually do WORK to help many people who are attacked They don t just talk like everyone here When you verbally attack those people you are verbally attacking people like me as well who just want to bring some good into the world It s so easy to criticize when you haven t seen the horrors firsthand and heard the stories of survivors In order to involve more people in the issue and expand to include men you may not want to bash half the people who are working to prevent and lessen these attacks in the first place But that s just my opinion 
I see now that there is a history of blocking people who you don t agree with so I expect I ll be next on that list Too bad this could have been a great article with great discussions but it s mostly moderators being unnecessarily rude to people asking genuinely curious questions and dodging all of those questions I believe that when you actually care about this issue you don t care who is helping You just care that they ARE Clearly nobody here actually cares about these acid attacks since they aim to slander feminist organizations that make up a large portion of the relief work I may not be a feminist but I would NEVER insult anybody who is actively working on this issue It makes me sad to see people preach peace but encourage anger and hostility towards a group of people and being unwilling to discuss in a scholarly manner That s called zealotry And when you are unable to accept that other people s viewpoints exist and you play God by blocking anybody s views you don t agree with you are no better than the very feminists that you attack Love your fellow human Love those who have the courage to act Feminist or humanist if you care about this issue you should be happy that there are those out there who do preventative work If you want to help by all means you should go do that I did And now I don t really care if you block me and label me as a troll I know that I m the very opposite of a troll because I ve dedicated my life to helping save lives and restore happiness to people who have been destroyed by these acid attacks and other human rights violations If anyone disagrees that s okay with me I can handle some opposition unlike people here And I know that at the end of the day I m a good person who is willing to put myself in extremely dangerous situations to help save lives instead of hiding behind a screen with a false sense of power because I can click a button and delete anything I don t like and choose to ignore reality Don t preach peace when all you want is hate I m sorry but the brutal maiming and often killing of victims is worse than some babbling feminazis who hide facts What about the babbling feminists who facilitate false rape claims that result in the brutal maiming and killing of innocent men Or are those men less imprtant to you than the victims of acid attacks Bias you say but what have you done to contribute to the issue of acid attacks Mmmm like maybe publishing an article that tells the part of the story that most people ignore and the mainstream media hides When you verbally attack those people you are verbally attacking people like me as well If you condone hiding nearly half of the perpetrators of this crime I would submit that you are contributing to the problem at least as much as you are trying to solve it Is that worthy of a verbal attack You bet it is I see now that there is a history of blocking people who you don t agree with We don t block people for disagreeing we block ideologues who can t stand it when we tell the part of the story that they want silenced Don t preach peace when all you want is hate Odd you don t seem to object to the hate of half the population which motivates feminist ideologues to protect vicious and dangerous women You re not a troll you re a fairly compassionate person who is very narrowly focused on one aspect of one problem so much so that you can t see or won t address an ideology which greatly exacerbates the problem you seek to solve You re putting a band aid on a gut wound What you call hate I call valid criticism of a hateful ideology Obviously just like so many of the other people who we don t agree with you don t seem to understand the point of the article nor what we are doing here The point of the article is spelt out in the title Please stop exhorting us to broaden the terms of the article to encompass a talk about an issue from a new perspective If you want an article that does that go write it Given your experience and passion likely it will be very valuable However we are agents of cultural change not acid attack activists Abusing us for not being what you demand we be will get you banned as it is abuse Something apparently you highly disapprove of given your criticism of it So do we Disagreeing with women or feminists is not abuse Banning ideologues is not abuse Preventing derailing is not abuse 
What we do here is force the conversation about gender bias into the public square against feminism s wishes We do NOT do acid attack activism AVfM is a publishing house Ever called out the NYT for writing a piece on poverty in Somalia but didn t go over and help out Kinda stupid You really need to get that for your own peace And a lot of effort goes into ensuring every thing done under this banner is congruent with that mission And despite your misgivings it is an honorable and important one I can t tell you how many comments I ve had pulled on various Feminist sites So now you re boo hooing when here the situation is reversed How does it feel to get EQUAL TREATMENT eh Isn t that what you Feminists want this is why Menisim exists Some men just dont want to take responsibility for the fact that how they think about and mistreat women affects the world An accurate estimate of the gender ratio of victims and perpetrators is difficult to establish because many acid attacks are not reported or recorded by authorities According to a study in The Lancet there are no reliable statistics on the prevalence of acid attacks A literature review analyzed studies in countries over the past years In the cases study men were more frequently victims in every country with the exception of Bangladesh and Taiwan with a male female ratio ranging from in Bangladesh to in the UK However according to the London based charity Acid Survivors Trust International percent of acid attacks are on women and acid assaults are grossly under estimated In some regions assaults perpetrated on female victims by males are often driven by the mentality If I can t have you no one shall 
In Bangladesh throwing acid has been labeled as a gender crime as there is a dominance of female victims who are assaulted by males for the reason of refusing to marry or refusing sexual advances from male perpetrators In Jamaica women throwing acid on other women in relation to fights over male partners is a common cause In the UK the majority of victims are men and many of these attacks are related to gang violence Another factor that puts victims at increased risk for an acid assault is their socioeconomic status as those living in poverty are more likely to be attacked As of the three nations with the most noted incidence of acid attacks Bangladesh India and Cambodia were ranked th st and th respectively out of countries on the Global Gender Gap Index a scale that measures equality in opportunities between men and women in nations So if you read carefully you know that most acid attacks are on men but they are from other men In the UK it s mostly gang members fighting other gang members It countries where women are treated very poorly like Cambodia and India acid attacks are carry out mostly by males against women So yes in some countries it is not a feminist issue In South East asia it definitely is So yes in some countries it is not a feminist issue In South East asia it definitely is Too bad that well funded Western feminists are so wrapped up in Manspreading and Eye Rape and that the also well funded UN is too busy protecting upper class white women from rude people on the internet to give a rats ass about women s problems in Souteast Asia Perhaps your time would be better spent criticizing women s rights groups You know like we do I see you are quoting from Wikipedia hardly a reliable source Even so vitriolage is a rare crime with no reliable statistics as to its prevalence largely due to spotty reporting of its incidence I read that in India male victims about were not even counted and a woefully one side and dare we say gendered treatment of it in the western media Until recently I was unaware that there were any male victims of vitriolage Type acid throwing in Google and hit images and all but perhaps one of two of the images are of female victims I suppose the media presumes that stories of female victims are more compelling and therefore good copy Then again women are conferred a more protected and untouchable status by society people are simply more offended by the perceived abuse of women than men To quote Alice Cooper Only women bleed Or is it that we only bleed for women Could this explain the near compete absence of media reporting on male victims of vitriolage I think not Rather male victims of vitriolage cannot be exploited ideologically Female victims can For feminists female victims of all sorts can be represented in a strategy that has ideological implications for the comprehension of current social problems 
A WOMAN who suffered devastating disfigurement after an acid attack has removed her mask to show her face for the first time Natalia Ponce de Leon has worn a mask since she had sulphuric acid thrown in her face by a stalker while visiting her mother in the Colombian capital Bogota in March The year old has endured operations to reconstruct her face using artificial skin from the Netherlands and has only appeared in public wearing a mask But on Monday she bravely laid bare her scars as she announced a new law that punishes perpetrators of acid attacks with up to years in prison Until now most Colombians convicted of acid attacks have received prison sentences of up to six years and some criminals have been allowed to serve their sentences under house arrest The new law defines acid attacks as a specific crime and increases the maximum sentence to years in jail for convicted offenders Acid attack victim whose face melted off in doorstep attack describes moment his life changed foreverNatalia has allowed people to see her face for the first time in two years to highlight the new legislation It also aims to ensure acid victims receive better state medical care With this law people will think twice before committing this act Ponce de Leon told local media 
Although acid attacks are most common in South Asia Colombia reported one of the highest rates per capita in the world in Since women and men have been attacked with acid across Colombia the country s National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences says The new law was spearheaded by and named after Ponce who underwent about operations to reconstruct her face using artificial skin The sulphuric acid melted the skin on her face neck abdomen and legs and left a quarter of her body burnt in an attack that shocked the South American country Ponce said a key challenge is ensuring state health authorities provide the medical care acid attack victims are now entitled to under the new law Victims often undergo months of reconstructive surgery and psychological therapy We don t want to see more people destroyed Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos said at the presidential palace when signing the law on Monday Doctors and activists say many acid attacks are committed by jealous vindictive husbands and boyfriends 
Acid attacks on the rise in Pakistan as women left disfigured and blinded for life in horrific assaultsThey say Colombia s macho culture condones violence against women and blames them for it Acid attacks survivors are often poor women with little education and a long history of domestic violence women s rights groups say About acid attacks are reported globally each year with women being the victims in percent of cases according to London based charity Acid Survivors Trust International which says the actual number is probably much higher since most victims are too scared to speak out While common in South Asia acid attacks also occur in the Middle East and Latin America where the Dominican Republic and Jamaica are hotspots for the crime JD Wetherspoon have decided to not allow Glasgow and surrounding area pubs to show the crunch cup tie which will be shown live on SKY WILLIAM BURNS was remanded in custody and stands accused of assaulting journalist Russell Findlay Sergei Yurevitch Filin born October is a Russian ballet dancer and the former Ballet Director of the Bolshoi Theater a position he assumed in In it was announced that his five year contract was not going to be renewed upon its expiration in March He is the former artistic director of the ballet at the Stanislavski and Nemirovich Danchenko Moscow Academic Music Theatre serving in this capacity from to 
A total of people were either injured by or threatened with harmful substances compared with in the previous months The disturbing figures emerged from a Freedom of Information request Wayne Ingold who had sulphuric acid thrown in his face in a case of mistaken identity in urged ministers to review legislation and sentencing Father of two Mr Ingold of Witham Essex said There has to be a stronger deterrent because these crimes are on the rise 
It s got ridiculous now One day someone will get killed Acid attack victim Wayne Ingold It s got ridiculous now One day someone will get killed We had gun crime and knife crime acid seems to be a cheaper alternative How would these people feel if a member of their family was the victim According to police figures people were injured by or threatened with corrosive substances between and Sulphuric acid drain cleaner chromic acid solution ammonia and patio cleaner were among the substances used in the assaults recorded between and Jaf Shah director of the Acid Survivors Trust International said The British Government needs to look into this subject with far greater seriousness to understand why these attacks are occurring and what can be done to prevent them occurring The Colombian government is taking action due to a huge public outcry which in turn led to changes in the law including tighter control on sale of acids and tougher sentencing of attackers The fact that the majority of victims in the UK are men goes against the global pattern where women tend to be victims 
The National Police Chiefs Council said violent crimes involving corrosive substances were on the rise in the UK and there were concerns that incidents were not being reported Deputy Chief Constable Andy Cooke the NPCC s lead on violence and public protection said The use of corrosive substances to commit acts of violence is something that we are seeing more of both in the UK and globally This type of offence is extreme and generally a very personalised crime with the aim being to cause lasting physical and emotional damage to victims It is virtually impossible to ban the sale of all corrosive substances as many are household products including for example bleach and drain cleaner and are readily available over the counter at DIY and pharmacy stores as well as supermarkets I am sure that some offences of this type are not reported as a crime to the police Crimes such as this should not go unreported and I would urge anyone who is a victim of this type of attack to report it so that we can deal with the matter positively and sensitively 
The Supreme Court today directed all the states and union territories UTs to compensate rehabilitate and provide free treatment to the survivors of acid attacks in pursuance of guidelines issued by it earlier A year old man accused of pouring acid on his girlfriend has been found incompetent to stand trial the case against Gregory Marsman is on hold while he undergoes treatment His lawyer had requested the evaluation The case can move forward if Marsman is found competent after treatment Marsman has been charged with torture home invasion and domestic violence and earlier deny breaking into the home in Allegan County s Ganges Township 
The victim year old Sheryl Keech was hospitalized with serious burns after the March attack The station reports that investigators allege Marsman made statements about Keech s son being possessed and demonic letters were found in Marsman s bedroom And we re not talking stepping in front of trains or falling off cliffs
A Bolshoi dancer convicted in for his role in an acid attack that scarred the face and eyes of the famed Russian ballet s artistic director has been paroled his lawyer said Wednesday Russian news agencies quoted the dancer s lawyer Sergei Kadyrov saying that Pavel Dmitrichenko was released Tuesday after a parole commission granted his request for an early release Dmitrichenko was found guilty of asking an ex convict to attack Sergei Filin who ended up losing much of his sight after acid was tossed onto his face outside his Moscow home Dmitrichenko was sentenced to years in prison in Filin s lawyer Tatyana Stukalova told Rossiya television that she would appeal the ruling because she says Dmitrichenko poses a danger to her client The January attack and the ensuing trial revealed deep divisions at Russia s most renowned theatre Some Bolshoi dancers sided with Dmitrichenko who insisted that he never contracted to have the attack done only complained about Filin Much of the trial centred less on Dmitrichenko s role in the attack than on whether or not Filin s management of the ballet company could have driven him to the crime As part of his defence the dancer cited several incidents in which troupe members were driven to tears by the artistic director The dancers who stood by year old Dmitrichenko who starred in the Bolshoi s Ivan the Terrible asked the court to acquit him arguing that a prison sentence for the Bolshoi principal dancer would kill his chances of resuming his career It was not clear if Dmitrichenko who has spent more than three years in prison would go back to professional dancing Six months after the attack the Russian culture ministry that oversees the Bolshoi Theatre replaced the long serving director general who was embroiled in a war of words with Filin s opponents Filin stayed on as the ballet s artistic director while undergoing treatment and rehabilitation until the Bolshoi last year refused to sign a new contract with him It hired Makhar Vaziev who left La Scala in Milan for the job in Moscow
