Were horrified by news reports of rape in India and feel lucky we dont live there. But the country with the highest rate of sexual assault isnt Indiaits us
Americans are reading with horror as sexual assault after sexual assault unfolds in India. Its easy to wonder Whats wrong with that country But we should be asking whats wrong with the United States too.
Rape and violence against women are a massive problem in India. According to the countrys National Crime Record Bureau crimes against women have increased by . percent since . The number of rapes reported has also risen. Nearly one in three rape victims in India is under the age of . One in are under . Every minutes in India a woman is raped.
And yet India only ranks third for the number of rapes reported each year. What country ranks first The United States. In India a country of over . billion people rapes were reported in . The same year in the United States a nation of million rapes were reported. In the United States every . minutes a woman is raped.
Even if sexual assault in India is dramatically underreported which most likely it is the statistical difference is still strikingas is our uniquely American inclination to dismiss such monstrous human rights violations as problems that other countries face. Not only is violence against women a global pandemic but the United States may be leading the pack.
Meanwhile the victim was blamed. Early on one of the coaches of the Steubenville High football team said the victim was just making up the rape. The victim and her family had to get police protection due to the level of threats against them. Two weeks ago a prominent local activitist in Steubenville spoke about the alleged victim even though the allegations had turned into a conviction and suggested according to a reporter that the victim might have been a willing participant. Meanwhile the woman who broke the story of the rapeshe is a local bloggerhas been harassed and threatened.
Isolated incident of smearing and shaming the victim Afraid not. Just weeks after the Steubenville story broke two high school football players in Torrington Connecticut were accused of raping a yearold girl. The response Dozens of people from the town took to social media to berate and blame the yearold accuser.
I am not sure if this is a good platform to spread awareness that women are not object of desire they must them be respected protected and encouraged to feel safe.
What country ranks first The United States. In India a country of over . billion people rapes were reported in . The same year in the United States a nation of million rapes were reported.Nice try guys this is absolutely and unequivocally FALSE Took some digging but googling this eventually brings you to a times article. In were sexually assaulted in America. That doesnt necessarily mean rape Sexual assault can be any kind of unwanted sexual touching. In that figure are people who got slapped on the ass kissed inappropriately fondled or grabbed.The study called the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey was begun in with the support of the National Institute of Justice and the Department of Defense. The study a continuing telephone survey of a nationally representative sample of adults defines intimate partner and sexual violence broadly.So these figures are not from police and court statistics they are from phone calls. Therefore the numbers are wildly inaccurate. Obviously the person who wrote this is playing hard and fast with the data.Only the FBI defines rape as actual oralgenital forced penetration. All these other idiotic sources consider rape any form of sexual assault which is grossly misleading and then used by morons to paint with large strokes in order to scare you or to demonize nations.
Islam on the other hand teaches women the importance of covering themselves so as to not to attract strange men. Not to travel alone without a male guardian. This is done in best interest of the women. Islam prohibits intoxication with alcohol as well. Alcohol and drug intoxication are a catalyst in rape.so next time do your research before you write something on a public forum.
I think the author has a point. I have lived in India for several years and I think all the readers who are lashing out against her are either muslim or communist. I dont trust either of them to tell the truth.Because of heavy islamic influence Indians are very sensitive about rape. And yes almost all rape is always reported the journalists jump on the stories and it quickly becomes international news. In the USA also most rapes are reported but nobody cares. The difference between rapists in India and in USA is the main shameful thing for India and Indians. While all rapists are scumbags in USA rape is more a power driven crime against women. In India it is sexual depravity. Higher number of men vs women poor education and several years of islamic influence of burqa and purda separate men and women schools and this up and rising influence of western culture creates a bad situation where the people want their daughters to go to school and have a career etc but the men still have had no real interaction with women and are still jerking off to porn. The reason for all the rape in India is the shameful part.
If you dont know something as basic as the difference between number of reported rapes and number of rapes then you have nothing of value to contribute to this topic. Ditto if you cant work out the difference between one segment of a society violating civil rights and a government that supports the violation of civil rights and refuses to support victims.I dont care if you are a cynical hack creating a fake beatup or merely incompetent. Do better.If you cant even manage that at least have the decency to spare the rest of us your sad attempts to write news. You are wasting everybody elses time and taking up space that could be used by a competent journalist.
There is no comparison. In India I cant ride a bus or any public transport cannot enjoy a day picnicing at a park reading on a bench relaxing at a beach or meditating outside during sunrise or sunset without getting eve teased google it.While rapes might be higher in the US and that is a big might the day to day life here is so much easier and freer for women because one is not getting stared at and eve teased at ever turn.I love my traditional Indian classical Hindu culture. Its such a shame that I cannot take my children to live and grow up in that beautiful land due to eve teasing and other horrific day to day realities.So until India weeds this and other dysfunctional traits out of its system we will stay in the US and I will teach my children meditation and classical Hindu practices as we sit peacefully on the beach during sunset and sunrise.
In India reported rape is very low. Indian consider rape is not a crime a social problem till its reported properly with police. Rape and sex is part of Indian culture and religion. Devdasis of Indian temples are sex worker but not prostitute collected from untouchable class the Dalit. Upper class Hindus consider Dalit women are their sex enjoyment. No Dalits have the guts to lodge a complain with police for rape first question asked in police station is what social class they belong if the answer is Dalit chapter is closed there. Even in court upper class sex offender get soft treatment over Dalit sex victim. Seriously reconsider rape statistics in India.
I have lived in all three regions India Middle East and in US overextended periods of time. I agree with the author that respect for women and children is the worst in US. Sure there are laws here but the laws are implemented by a patriarchical society where males have more power. The police is as corrupt here than in India except that the corruption is more in terms of racism. Women are treated like crap in US and when I first came here I was apalled and would take it personally till I realised that it is just how the culture is. So horrific have been my experiences in and of United States that I am leaving the country next year for good with my children. I do not wish to bring up my children in this society. I feel more protected by law and society in India and Middle East. Sure we have horrible men like these rapists but the rest of the men in these regions have compassion and decency. In my opinion in this country even the judiciary is aligned against women and children. All laws all talk all hot air.att PR to seduce the world nothing in reality.
This article is absolutely ridiculous. You have not done your research trying to prove America is not better off than India. Americans are under the false impression regarding the treatment of women and India better. Are you for real You just pulled cases to prove your point. Also the statistics you used was the crime committed by immigrants or American citizens If you are going to write something make sure you have all your facts. I will admit America is not perfect and we have room to grow. We havent chosen our first Women president we are well aware Women have struggles in the U.S. However it is nothing compared to how India treats its women. Not all rape cases are handled the same.

Police are braced for more protests after the victim of a brutal gang rape attack on a bus in New Delhi dies in hospital.
Indian police are bracing themselves for more protests after a yearold woman who was gang raped on a bus in New Delhi died in a Singapore hospital.
The attack in which the medical student was savagely beaten and raped for almost an hour before being thrown out of the moving vehicle sparked demonstrations across India.
The chief executive of the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore where she was flown for specialist treatment on Thursday said she had suffered severe organ failure.
Despite all efforts by a team of eight specialists . to keep her stable her condition continued to deteriorate over these two days. She had suffered from severe organ failure following serious injuries to her body and brain.
She was courageous in fighting for her life for so long against the odds but the trauma to her body was too severe for her to overcome.
Crowds of protesters have gathered in New Delhi city centre for a sitin demanding political change to protect women from violence.
The area is home to the presidents palace the prime ministers office and key defence foreign affairs and home ministries.
Authorities fear a repeat of demonstrations a week ago where police fired tear gas and water cannon at activists.
But Daily Telegraph journalist RahulBedi who is in New Delhi said protesters were likely to remain peaceful to avoid giving the politicians a tool to criticise them.
I think theres a conscious decision on the part of the protesters in the land of Gandhi to protest in a nonviolent way he added.
These sitins are going to continue for a long time. This crime has shocked the country. Rape is something this country has been dancing around for the last or years.
The Indian High Commissioner to Singapore told reporters a chartered aircraft would fly the victims body back to India on Saturday along with members of her family.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was deeply saddened by the womans death and described the reaction to the case as perfectly understandable from a young India and an India that genuinely desires change.
It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channelthese emotions and energies into a constructive course of action he added.
Police have arrested six men over the attack which happened two weeks ago as the woman was travelling home on a bus with a male friend after a trip to the cinema.
According to media reports six men on the bus beat them with metal rods and repeatedly raped the woman. Her male companion survived the assault.
The case triggered nationwide protests which culminated last weekend in clashes with police in the Indian capital.

Half the time people cant even seem to figure out how to define rape let alone portray it in responsible ways. Indeed one of the most baffling things about so many rape scenes in popular culture is that the people who scripted them felt qualified to do so despite seemingly knowing nothing about rape except that it exists and it is bad. In short anyone can write a rape scenebut should they Chances are the answer is no. 
From reinforcing falsehoods about sexual violence to the objectification of women heres why that rape storyline is probably a bad idea and a pretty uncreative one too. 
One of the reasons why rape remains so terrifyingly pervasive is far too often no one is willing to call it what it is. Weve generally agreed as a culture that rape is bad but since people want to continue to commit and excuse rape they resolve that cognitive dissonance by defining rape in incredibly narrow ways that distance it from themselves and the people they know. Behold the rise of euphemisms like gray rape and rape rape aka real rape. 
Take for example Game of Thrones which filmed a rape scene for Season without realizing it was a rape scene. After it aired its director continued to insist that it was not rape despite the female character saying no and stop while her assailant pushed her down saying I dont care. Instead the director explained that the assault becomes consensual by the enddespite no clear verbal or physical indication of thatand that the coercion was actually a turnon for the woman. Which leads neatly into another cardinal sin of bad rape scenes
The impulse to sexualize women is so kneejerk and compulsive that sexiness becomes functionally mandatory which sets the stage for maximum creepiness any time those characters suffer and particularly when they suffer sexual violence. 
As Rachel Edidin wrote in her critique of sexualized rape scenes Women are exaggeratedlyand alwayssexy. Theyre sexy on the phone. Sexy on the job. Sexy fighting. Sexy tortured. Sexy dead. Sexy raped.
If youre a woman in media youre basically the sexy Halloween costume of human beings in a world where Halloween never ends. Again I cannot believe I have to say this but if a movie or TV show cant visualize a woman in nonsexual terms even for the brief duration of a rape scene it has no business depicting rape scenes.
For reasons that almost uniformly do not speak well of us as a species when rape is introduced as a part of a characters storylineeither in the past or the presentwe seem to need those assaults to play out before our eyes in order for them to seem real.
But where the movie made an active effort to get things right with its female characterseven bringing in Vagina Monologues author Eve Ensler to consultwhen it came time to make a comic book the story got turned over to an allmale team that immediately introduced a rape backstory to motivate its main female character Furiosa and immediately put the previously offscreen rapes in the comic.
The use of institutionalised rape by Immortan Joe is not only central to the story but without it the story could be viewed merely as a bunch of young spoilt girls whining about being kept in relative luxury by an older man whos concerned with their safety. Not really much room for dramatic tension there
There are quite a few things wrong with this response but the idea that sexually enslaved women are in danger of seeming spoiled unless they are raped before our very eyes is surely the most contemptible.
Because rape is widely acknowledged as a Very Serious Topic theres also a tendency to treat rape scenes as a means to be edgy or shocking. You know as a way of creating really serious mature content. Most of the time however this approach radiates nothing so much as ignorance and immaturity.
Adding yet another manipulative rape scene is not just one of the most offensive things a writer can do it is also one of the most boring.
This also holds true when writing backstories for female characters and trying to create challenges and struggles that motivate and shape them as individuals. Theres a tendency in media to reduce women to their genitals and what men want to do to their genitals too often the combination of woman and bad thing that happened in the past defaults to something bad happened to her genitals probably.
In reality millions of other bad things happen to women every daycar crashes tornados gentrification crappy health insuranceso unless there is a highly specific and deeply considered reason to use rape its better to use literally any of those instead. And if rape is the only tool someone has in their bag for creating complex female characters its time to get another bag.
While Ive talked a lot about rape scenes in regards to female victims thats largely because rape victims in media are almost exclusively portrayed as women. But thats not the complete picture of sexual assault which is experienced by plenty of men and nonbinary people. But those arent stories we often see depicted indeed the sexual assault of men is disproportionately ignored by the stories we tell about rape. 
So why is rape such a comparatively easy weapon to wield against female characters but not male ones The most likely and upsetting answer is that we as a culture are are more comfortable seeing women raped which is not only messed up for women but wholly erases the experiences of male survivorsnot to mention encouraging the equally crappy stereotype that the rape of men isnt a real thing. This should go without saying but of course it is.
The idea that rape is committed by people you know against other people you know is a difficult truth to swallow and thats why its often avoided in fiction. Its more comforting to believe that rape is usually committed by drooling perverts lurking in alleys and the narrative in movies TV and other media that rape is just stranger danger remains popular in part because it bears so little resemblance to the reality of rape and renders it safely distant. 
Yes there are stories about rape that are worth telling. But without extensive research into the problems stereotypes and struggles that rape survivors faceincluding what makes sexual assault different from other forms of violenceits too easy for fictional depictions to contribute to those issues rather than combat them. With so many other narrative tools out there using sexual assault is almost always unnecessary. There are better ways to tell nearly any story so why use the one that tends to be both the laziest and the most harmful

More than a quarter also believe a woman is at least partly responsible for being raped if she wears sexy or revealing clothing or is drunk the study found.
One in five think a woman is partly to blame if it is known she has many sexual partners while more than a third believe she is responsible to some degree if she has clearly failed to say no to the man.
In each of these scenarios a slightly greater proportion of men than women held these views except when it came to being drunk when it was equal.
In fact more women pc than men pc thought a woman was totally responsible for being raped if she was intoxicated.
The national charity Victim Support urged criminal justice professionals and healthcare workers to consider how best to educate people about the terrible impact of rape with a view to changing these attitudes.
The ICM opinion poll commissioned by Amnesty International also revealed that the vast majority of the British population has no idea how many women are raped every year in the UK.
Almost all per cent of respondents said they either did not know the true extent of rape or thought it was far lower than the true figure.
Only per cent even thought the number of women raped exceeded . The number of recorded rapes in was more than and the British Crime Survey estimated that just per cent of rapes come to the attention of the police.
Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen said the poll part of its Stop Violence Against Women campaign had uncovered disturbing attitudes.
The research had also exposed the scale of public ignorance over the true extent of rape crimes in the UK and the dreadfully low conviction rates she said.
The government has an international duty to prevent this gross human rights violation yet its clear that the governments policies on tackling rape are failing and failing badly she said.
These findings should act as a wakeup call to the government to urgently tackle the triple problem of the high incidence of rape low conviction rates and a sexist blame culture.
Rape is an appalling crime and has a devastating effect on victims and those close to them. In other words nobody asks to be raped.
If that is the standard set by the people who are supposed to be prosecuting rapists and protecting us it is not surprising if members of the public say the same thing.
Sheila Coates director of the South Essex Rape and Incest Crisis Centre said the poll showed people had little idea about the true extent of rape in the UK.
The situation for rape victims and womens specialist sexual violence services are at critical she said.
Those needing counselling face waiting lists of up to one year and this can only get worse as more rape crisis groups close or cut back services due to a lack of funding and government support. This situation has forced victims into a postcode lottery when trying to find support.
The Home Office said it was determined to increase the number of rape cases which were successfully prosecuted.
We are determined to close the gap between the increasing number of rape cases reported and the low number of convictions.
The number of recorded rapes of a female in was up from in an increase of per cent. The number of convictions for rape of a female in was up from in .
They were given a series of scenarios and asked to indicate whether they believed a woman was totally responsible partially responsible or not at all responsible for being raped.
If the woman was drunk pc said she was totally responsible and pc said she was partially responsible.
If the woman behaved in a flirtatious manner pc said she was totally responsible and pc said she was partially responsible.
If the woman failed to say no clearly to the man pc said she was totally responsible and pc said she was partially responsible.
If the woman was wearing sexy or revealing clothing pc said she was totally responsible and pc said she was partially responsible.
If it is known that the woman has many sexual partners pc said she was totally responsible and pc said she was partially responsible.
If she is alone and walking in a dangerous or deserted area pc said she was totally responsible and pc said she was partially responsible.

Scrutiny of sexual violence in India has grown since the gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus.
The government tightened laws on sexual violence last year after widespread protests following the attack. 
Fasttrack courts were brought to the fore to deal with rape and the death penalty was also brought in for the most extreme cases.
Some womens groups argue that the low conviction rate for rape should be challenged with more effective policing rather than stiffer sentences.
The UKs Iraq War inquiry says Tony Blair overstated Saddam Husseins threat sent illprepared troops into battle and had wholly inadequate plans for the aftermath.
One of the group of Indian men convicted of the notorious Delhi gang rape of has prompted outrage by claiming that his victim was to blame for her brutal sexual assault and murder. 
In an interview from jail Mukesh Singh said that women who went out at night had only themselves to blame if they attracted the attention of gangs of male molesters. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy he said. 
His victim Jyoti Singh was returning from an evening at the cinema with a male friend when the sixstrong gang offered them a lift in a minibus they were driving. She was raped and frenziedly beaten with iron bars prompting widespread demonstrations for Indian women to have greater protection from sexual violence. 
India bans broadcast of interview with rapist Interview left stain on my soul says film maker 
In an interview for a BBC documentary Singh also claimed that had Jyoti and her friend not tried to fight back the gang would not have not have inflicted the savage beating which led her to die from her injuries two weeks later. 
The interview which BBC Four will air on its Storyville programme to coincide with International Womens Day this Sunday will be seen by womens rights groups as compelling evidence of the appalling attitudes shown by many Indian men towards women. 
Asha Singh the rape victims mother with Savitri Devi the victims sisterin law 
While the Indian courts made a harsh example of the gang passing death sentences that are now otherwise rarely used campaigners say that otherwise not enough has changed. 
Singh a slumdweller who was at the time of the attack was driving the bus when the abduction occurred. 
He denied involvement in the attack itself but his claims were rejected by the court which said there was strong DNA evidence against him and that even if he had not taken part he should have intervened. 
But while the judge said that the case had shocked the collective conscience of India Singh appears to show little remorse. 
You cant clap with one hand it takes two hands he says in the interview. A decent girl wont roam around at oclock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things wearing wrong clothes. About per cent of girls are good. 
Singh whose death sentence is currently on appeal also claims that executing him and the other convicted rapists will endanger future rape victims. 
The death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls he says. Before they would rape and say Leave her she wont tell anyone. Now when they rape especially the criminal types they will just kill the girl. Death. 
Do teenagers understand sex and consent To find out a group of yearolds were shown a specially written drama about an incident to see if they could work out if it was consensual sex or whether a crime had been committed.
Sex and consent is a much discussed issue at the moment and secondary schools are introducing sexual consent lessons. 
The world of sex and relationships is a difficult one for teenagers to navigate. To hear in their own words where the challenges lie the BBC brought together teenagers of each sex to watch a drama set at a house party and debate whether rape had been committed. 
The teenagers watch a dramatised house party in which a sexual encounter takes place. They debate whether they think the female character Gemma consented to that encounter and then vote on what happened. Lawyer Abigail Husbands who specialises in rape trials and advised on the storyline of the drama gives her feedback. 
Tom spots Gemma a girl he once briefly went out with at a party chatting to his friend Phil. Gemma and Tom meet in the kitchen where they have a friendly chat while getting some drinks.
Gemma dances with her friends. She shoots off flirty glances in the direction of Tom and Phil. Later Tom walks in on Phil and Gemma kissing in the bathroom. They laugh he appears upset. Tom continues to drink then falls asleep in the kitchen. The party ends and Gemma makes up a bed for herself in the living room. Tom wakes up and stumbles in. A while later Tom asks Gemma who is dozing if he can share the sofa with her as he is cold. She agrees but insists he must be quiet as she wants to sleep. 
Tom moves closer to her and she stirs slightly. He tells her how gorgeous she looked at the party and reminds her of a previous episode when they had ended up getting off with each other. Gemma drifts off. Tom moves even closer and Gemma briefly opens her eyes but doesnt respond. Tom puts his hand on her face she very slightly tries to move away but doesnt say anything. Toms hands are on Gemmas face. He manoeuvres himself on top of Gemma who remains rigidly still and silent. Tom puts his hands on the back of Gemmas neck and puts his penis in her mouth.
Two weeks later Gemma contacts the police to say that someone she knew did something to her.
The panel are given more information about Tom and Gemma they discuss the issue of consent and then vote on whether they think Tom believed he had consent. 
Tom is arrested on a charge of rape. He maintains that he believes Gemma had consented. He says she sent him a text message inviting him to the party which was signed off with three kisses. But the text message was sent to a group and not just to Tom. He points out that they got physically close when they chatted at the party. Gemma maintains the music was so loud they had to get close to hear each other. And he says she was flirting and constantly looking over at him. Tom however had been standing with Phil whom it was revealed Gemma had had sex with the week before. 
This section focuses on how Gemma reacted. The teenagers are then asked to vote on whether they think Tom is guilty of rape.
Tom says that he and Gemma had been kissing on the sofa but when questioned about whether she had in fact kissed him back he says he cant remember. He argues that at no point did Gemma say stop she didnt seem upset and that her lack of response indicated she was into it. Gemma however says she didnt do anything because she hoped he would get the message and stop. She says she then just froze. 
Throughout the process some of the teenagers changed their minds about whether Tom believed he had consent. 
During their time together some of the teenagers opened up about their own sexual experiences revealing just how blurred the lines around consent are.
Finally a teenager who revealed that she herself had been raped showed her frustration as others grappled with the definition of rape and the fact that Tom had been convicted of the crime in the scenario

The controversial Stanford rape case which resulted in studentathlete Brock Turner being sentenced to just six months in jail for raping a woman at the prestigious university has once again riveted the nations attention to sexual assault crisis on Americas campuses although as far as ProtectHer founder Alexis Jones is concerned.
The statement of the yearold physiotherapy student who was gangraped and assaulted on a moving bus on December was recorded by a subdivisional magistrate at the Safdarjung Hospital here on Friday night.
In her detailed statement which was hailed as fearless and bold by Deputy Commissioner of Police South District Chhaya Sharma the victim provided an account of the horror she and her male friend went through on the fateful night. Ms. Sharma said the womans statement corroborated that of her yearold software engineer friend.
The victim purportedly told the SDM that around . p.m. while she and her friend were standing at a bus stop at Munirka they were called into the bus by the juvenile accused Rahul name changed who told them that the bus would go towards Palam. On entering the vehicle the victims found that in all there were six others besides them in the vehicle.
A few minutes into the ride her friend got suspicious as the bus had deviated from the supposed route and the other occupants had shut the door. When he objected the six accused taunted them asking what they were doing together so late in the night.
A scuffle then ensued between the software engineer and others. The yearold was hit on the head by Ram Singh. The woman was then dragged to the rear end of the vehicle by Rahul and Akshay Singh.
In her statement the woman said that after hitting her friend who fell unconscious Ram Singh went to the back of the bus and was the first to force himself on her. It is learnt that the girl had heard some names while the attackers were calling out to each other.
As they were being brutalised the attackers threatened both the victims that they would be thrown out of the bus. Initially the accused had only intended to throw the boy out of the vehicle but later they changed their mind after both the victims fell unconscious due to the torture they were subjected to.
About minutes after boarding the bus the two were thrown off it by the accused at Mahipalpur. The attackers had also robbed the victims of their clothes and belongings.
Meanwhile the Delhi Police on Saturday initiated action against three personnel for alleged inaction in a robbery case involving the bus on which the gangrape and assault was committed. 
Constables Kailash Ashok and Sandeep of the Hauz Khas station have been suspended for not acting promptly when the occupants of the bus had robbed a carpenter Ramadhar after giving him a lift in their area just before committing the gangrape.
In another development five personnel of the Connaught Place police station subinspector Rajeshwar head constable Inder Pal and constables Jagmal Pardeep and Chottelal were placed under suspension after Union Home Secretary R.K. Singh found some people drinking in the open in the vicinity of the police station where these personnel were on duty.

A man who allegedly drugged and raped his wife has been acquitted after a judge confirmed Indian rape laws do not apply to married couples. 
Feminist campaigners said the judgment highlighted the failure of Indian law to protect the majority of women in the country those who are married from being raped or their right to refuse to have sex with their husbands. 
In this latest case the women whose identity was not revealed claimed her marriage was illegal and had been conducted against her will after she had been sedated. 
A man identified only as Vikash had taken her to a registry office in Ghaziabad just outside New Delhi in March last year where he forced her to sign a marriage certificate while she was intoxicated. He later raped her and then fled she alleged. 
The accused denied drugging the woman or raping her and said their marriage had been consensual. She had only alleged rape six months after their marriage when they became involved in a property dispute. 
In his judgment Judge Virender Bhat said there was no evidence Vikash had drugged his wife or forced her to marry him but even if he had forced the complainant to have sex with him it would not be a crime under Indian law. 
The prosecutrix the wife and the accused Vikash being legally wedded husband and wife and the prosecutrix being major the sexual intercourse between the two even if forcible is not rape and no culpability can be fastened upon the accused the court ruled. 
The ruling was made just over a year after the Indian government strengthened its rape laws and increased sentences amid a public outcry over the gangrape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus. 
The changes were based on the recommendations of the Verma Committee headed by the late Justice Verma who also urged the government to criminalise rape within marriage. 
Under the Indian Penal Code sexual intercourse without consent is prohibited. However an exception to the offence of rape exists in relation to unconsented sexual intercourse by a husband upon a wife. The Committee recommended that the exception to marital rape should be removed. Marriage should not be considered as an irrevocable consent to sexual acts the Committee said in its report. 
His recommendation however was rejected amid fears that it would encourage false cases and damage the institution of arranged marriages which are usually based on financial deals between families. 
Rape within marriage is not illegal in India which says everything about the position of women. We are donated for marriage rather than enter it as a partner. The ownership is with the man and whatever he does after marriage is acceptable said Ranjana Kumari a womens rights campaigner who lobbied members of parliament on the issue. 
Nilanjana Roy a leading author and campaigner said the law as it stands in India offers no protection to women raped by their husbands but can intervene in cases of domestic violence. 
Under Indian law what the judge has said is correct and that is horrifying. Its easier for a woman to file a case for a black eye. If a woman is being repeatedly raped in a marriage and he does not use extreme violence she has no recourse in law there is nothing she can do she said. 
Last months brutal gang rape of a young woman in the Indian capital Delhi has caught public attention and caused worldwide outrage. But here the BBCs Geeta Pandey in Delhi recalls other prominent cases which made the headlines then faded from public memory.
On most days Indian newspapers report shocking new atrocities a monthold raped by a neighbour in Delhi an monthold raped and abandoned on the streets in Calcutta a yearold raped and murdered in a police station in Uttar Pradesh a husband facilitating his own wifes gang rape in Howrah a yearold grandmother raped in Kharagpur.
But in a country where a rape is reported every minutes even these most horrific of crimes soon get forgotten except by the victims and their families.
They are left to fight their long lonely battles for justice which more often than not is denied to them.
One of the most painful and lingering cases is that of the Mumbai nurse Aruna Shanbaug.
Sodomised by a cleaner in the hospital where she worked the yearold was strangled with metal chains and left to die by her attacker Sohanlal Bharta Walmiki on November .
She was saved and survives but barely so. For the past years she has been lying in a hospital bed in a vegetative state brain dead unable to recognise anyone unable to speak unable to perform even the most basic of tasks.
He was not even charged for raping her says journalist and author Pinki Virani who wrote Arunas Story a book on the nurses plight. 
So Walmiki was given a light sevenyearsentence for robbery and attempted murder.
In what can be described as a real travesty of justice while a brain dead Aruna remains confined to a hospital room her attacker roams free out of jail and able to rebuild his life.
Ms Virani told the BBC that she tried hard to track him down but remained unsuccessful.
I was told that he had changed his name and was working as a ward boy in a Delhi hospital. The hospital where he had sodomised Aruna and left her in this permanent vegetative condition had never kept a photo of him on file. Neither did the court papers she said.
Aruna is not alone her story is repeated with a frightening regularity across the length and breadth of the country.
Violence against women is deeply entrenched in the feudal patriarchal Indian society where for the rapist every woman is fair game. 
In the country was shamed when a yearold Swiss diplomat was forced into her own car by two men in south Delhis posh Siri Fort area and raped by one of them. The rapist whom she described as being fluent in English spoke to her about Switzerland and is believed to have even lectured her on Indian culture.
In in Manipur yearold Manorama was taken away from home by the soldiers of Assam Rifles who accused her of helping insurgents. A few hours later her mutilated body was found by the roadside her pelvis riddled with dozens of bullets.
Last year yearold Sonam was raped and killed inside a police station in Uttar Pradesh.
During the riots in Gujarat a number of Muslim women were gangraped and campaign groups routinely accuse the security forces in Indianadministered Kashmir and the troubled northeast of using rape as a weapon to punish the entire community.
In May Indianadministered Kashmir witnessed days of violent protests and strikes after two young women were raped and murdered allegedly by police in Shopian town. 
And in Chhattisgarh Soni Sori has been in police custody since October when she was arrested on charges of being a courier for the Maoists. She has alleged in the Supreme Court that while in custody she has been raped and stones have been shoved inside her vagina.
Most of these victims are still waiting for justice sometimes years after the crimes have been committed. 
The rapists sometimes escape with a light sentence because a judge accepts their argument that they committed the crime because they were drunk or that they were living away from their family or they had a family to look after or that the accused was a highcaste man who could not rape a Dalit low caste woman.
The Additional Solicitor General of India Indira Jaisingh says the current rape laws in the country are far from adequate and the process of justice delivery is too slow and the rate of conviction too low.
We have to improve the crime investigation methodology we have to make it more scientific and quick. In India a case takes so long to conclude that witnesses get dissipated memory frays and conviction becomes tougher.
She says many cases do not even get to court because there is a stigma attached to rape and families would often discourage their daughters from complaining. 
Ms Jaisingh says that just drafting a better law will not be enough it is society which has to change. 
There is no magic formula to deal with the problem of rape. Theres a bias that operates in the mind of decision makers stereotyping women blaming the victim trying to find out if she invited the rape.
The first such incident in India occurred in when Mathura a yearold tribal girl was raped by two policemen inside a police station. 
The courts set free the accused they said she did not raise an alarm she was not injured and since she was sexually active she would have voluntarily consented to sex. 
Howls of angry protests from activists led to the government amending the antirape law in to accommodate the provision that if a victim says that she did not consent to sex the court will believe her.
The outpouring of anger and grief after the recent Delhi incident has also given rise to hopes that things are about to change in India.
The government has formed a committee under retired Supreme Court Justice JS Verma to take a fresh look at the antirape law. 
Justice Verma has invited suggestion from the public and his inbox is reported to be full of demands for the death penalty and chemical castration for rapists. Many are also calling for longer jail sentences of up to years or even life in jail.
But campaigners say laws alone may not be able to solve the problem in a society which treats its women as secondclass citizens and regards them inferior to men.
They say until social attitudes change and women are respected and treated as equals the gains from the protests will be shortlived.

One of the group of Indian men convicted of the notorious Delhi gang rape of has prompted outrage by claiming that his victim was to blame for her brutal sexual assault and murder. 
In an interview from jail Mukesh Singh said that women who went out at night had only themselves to blame if they attracted the attention of gangs of male molesters. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy he said. 
His victim Jyoti Singh was returning from an evening at the cinema with a male friend when the sixstrong gang offered them a lift in a minibus they were driving. She was raped and frenziedly beaten with iron bars prompting widespread demonstrations for Indian women to have greater protection from sexual violence. 
India bans broadcast of interview with rapist Interview left stain on my soul says film maker 
In an interview for a BBC documentary Singh also claimed that had Jyoti and her friend not tried to fight back the gang would not have not have inflicted the savage beating which led her to die from her injuries two weeks later. 
The interview which BBC Four will air on its Storyville programme to coincide with International Womens Day this Sunday will be seen by womens rights groups as compelling evidence of the appalling attitudes shown by many Indian men towards women. 
Asha Singh the rape victims mother with Savitri Devi the victims sisterin law 
While the Indian courts made a harsh example of the gang passing death sentences that are now otherwise rarely used campaigners say that otherwise not enough has changed. 
Singh a slumdweller who was at the time of the attack was driving the bus when the abduction occurred. 
He denied involvement in the attack itself but his claims were rejected by the court which said there was strong DNA evidence against him and that even if he had not taken part he should have intervened. 
But while the judge said that the case had shocked the collective conscience of India Singh appears to show little remorse. 
You cant clap with one hand it takes two hands he says in the interview. A decent girl wont roam around at oclock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things wearing wrong clothes. About per cent of girls are good. 
Singh whose death sentence is currently on appeal also claims that executing him and the other convicted rapists will endanger future rape victims. 
The death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls he says. Before they would rape and say Leave her she wont tell anyone. Now when they rape especially the criminal types they will just kill the girl. Death.

In an Indian student was violently raped on a moving bus in Delhi and died of horrific internal injuries. Leslee Udwin spoke to one of the rapists on death row while spending two years making a film about the case. She came away shocked by Indias treatment of women but inspired by those seeking change.
The horrifying details of the rape had led me to expect deranged monsters. Psychopaths. The truth was far more chilling. These were ordinary apparently normal and certainly unremarkable men. 
On December the yearold woman had been to see a film the Life of Pi with a male friend. At .pm they boarded an offduty bus with six men on board five adults and a juvenile. The men beat the friend and each raped the woman in turn before assaulting her viciously with an iron instrument.
Mukesh Singh the driver of the bus described to me every detail of what happened during and after the incident. While prosecutors say the men took turns to drive the bus and all took part in the rape Singh says he stayed at the wheel throughout. 
Along with three of the other attackers Singh is now appealing against his death sentence. In hours of interviews Singh showed no remorse and kept expressing bewilderment that such a fuss was being made about this rape when everyone was at it.
A decent girl wont roam around at nine oclock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy he said.
Housework and housekeeping is for girls not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things wearing wrong clothes. About of girls are good. 
People had a right to teach them a lesson he suggested and he said the woman should have put up with it. 
When being raped she shouldnt fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape. Then theyd have dropped her off after doing her and only hit the boy he said. 
I had the long and shocking list of injuries the young woman had sustained read out to him. I tried really hard to search for a glimmer of regret. There was none.
It would be easier to process this heinous crime if the perpetrators were monsters and just the rotten apples in the barrel aberrant in nature. Perhaps then those of us who believe that capital punishment serves a purpose and I am not among them could wring their hands in relief when they hang.
For me the truth couldnt be further from this and perhaps their hanging will even mask the real problem which is that these men are not the disease they are the symptoms.
My encounter with Singh and four other rapists left me feeling like my soul had been dipped in tar and there were no cleaning agents in the world that could remove the indelible stain. 
One of the men I interviewed Gaurav had raped a fiveyearold girl. I spent three hours filming his interview as he recounted in explicit detail how he had muffled her screams with his big hand. 
He was sitting throughout the interview and had a halfsmile playing on his lips throughout his nervousness in the presence of a camera perhaps. At one point I asked him to tell me how tall she was. He stood up and with his eerie halfsmile indicated a height around his knees. 
These offences against women and girls are a part of the story but the full story starts with a girl not being as welcome as a boy from birth. When sweets are distributed at the birth of a boy not of a girl. When the boy child is nourished more than the girl when a girls movements are restricted and her freedoms and choices are curtailed when she is sent as a domestic slave to her husbands home If a girl is accorded no value if a girl is worth less than a boy then it stands to reason there will be men who believe they can do what they like with them.
I spoke to two lawyers who had defended the murderers of the yearold student at their trial and what they said was extremely revealing.
You are talking about man and woman as friends. Sorry that doesnt have any place in our society. We have the best culture. In our culture there is no place for a woman. 
He did not disown that comment when I put it to him. This is my stand he said. I still today stand on that reply. 
Genderinequality is the primary tumour and rape trafficking child marriage female foeticide honour killings and so on are the metastases. And in India the problem is not lack of laws after all India is a democracy and a civilised rapidly developing country. The problem is implementation of them. 
Article of the Indian Constitution confers absolute equal rights on women. The giving of dowry is a legal offence but many families maintain the custom nonetheless. Until and unless the mindset changes the cancer will thrive and continue to spread.
But what compelled me to leave my family and go to Delhi to make this film was not the rape itself nor the horror of it. It was what followed.
Starting on the day after the rape and for over a month ordinary men and women came out on to the streets of Indias cities in unprecedented numbers to protest. They braved a freezing December and a ferocious government crackdown of water cannons baton charges and teargas shells. Their courage and determination to be heard was extraordinarily inspiring.
There was something momentous about their presence and perseverance reminiscent to me of the crowds that had thronged Tahrir Square in Cairo a gathering of civil society that demanded a conversation that was long overdue. 
It occurred to me that for all its appalling record of violence against women and relentless rapes here was India leading the world by example. I couldnt recall another country in my lifetime standing up with such tenacity for women for me. And I knew at once that I simply had to use whatever talents and skills I had to amplify their cries of enough is enough which were reverberating across the whole world. 
As is often the case with extremely challenging endeavours where the human stakes are high the main struggle for me was the emotional and psychological toll the work imposed. 
When you look into the blackest recesses of the human heart you cannot but be depressed and deeply disappointed. I woke one morning on the shoot wet from head to toe bathed in sweat and fear and my heart knocking against my ribcage. This was a panic attack. I phoned home thinking my husband would answer but my yearold daughter Maya did.

The Khanke IDP camp outside of Dohuk is home to more than Yezidis and other Iraqi families who were displaced by the conflict. 
New York The extremist group Islamic State also known as ISIS has carried out systematic rape and other sexual violence against Yezidi women and girls in northern Iraq. Human Rights Watch conducted research in the town of Dohuk in January and February including interviewing women and girls who escaped from ISIS and reviewing ISIS statements about the subject.
Human Rights Watch documented a system of organized rape and sexual assault sexual slavery and forced marriage by ISIS forces. Such acts are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity. Many of the women and girls remain missing but the survivors now in Iraqi Kurdistan need psychosocial support and other assistance.
ISIS forces have committed organized rape sexual assault and other horrific crimes against Yezidi women and girls said Liesl Gerntholtz womens rights director at Human Rights Watch. Those fortunate enough to have escaped need to be treated for the unimaginable trauma they endured.
ISIS forces took several thousand Yezidi civilians into custody in northern Iraqs Nineveh province in August according to Kurdistan officials and community leaders. Witnesses said that fighters systematically separated young women and adolescent girls from their families and other captives and moved them from one location to another inside Iraq and Syria.
The women and girls Human Rights Watch interviewed had escaped between September and January . Half including two yearold girls said they had been raped some multiple times and by several ISIS fighters. Nearly all of them said they had been forced into marriage sold in some cases a number of times or given as gifts. The women and girls also witnessed other captives being abused.
Human Rights Watch also interviewed more than a dozen international and local service providers medical workers Kurdish officials community leaders and activists who corroborated these accounts. A local doctor treating female survivors in Dohuk told Human Rights Watch that of the women and girls she had examined appeared to have been raped in ISIS captivity.
All of the women and girls interviewed exhibited signs of acute emotional distress. Many remain separated from relatives and sometimes their entire families who were either killed by ISIS or remain in ISIS captivity. Several said they had attempted suicide during their captivity or witnessed suicide attempts to avoid rape forced marriage or forced religious conversion.
In October ISIS acknowledged in its publication Dabiq that its fighters had given captured Yezidi women and girls to its fighters as spoils of war. ISIS has sought to justify sexual violence claiming that Islam permits sex with nonMuslim slaves including girls as well as beating and selling them. The statements are further evidence of a widespread practice and a systematic plan of action by ISIS Human Rights Watch said.
ISIS commanders should immediately release all civilian detainees reunite children with their families and end forced marriages and religious conversions Human Rights Watch said. They should take all necessary action to end rape and other sexual violence by ISIS fighters. International and local actors who have influence with ISIS should press the group to take these actions.
In the Kurdistan Regional Government KRG absorbed more than displaced people from Nineveh province alone and made significant efforts to provide health and other services to Yezidi women and girls who have escaped ISIS. However there have been flaws and gaps in health care Human Rights Watch said. Some of those interviewed said they underwent medical tests but did not know the purpose and were never told the results.
The director general for health in Dohuk told Human Rights Watch that local authorities had identified fewer than women and girls who had escaped from ISIS and that only about had received medical treatment. According to the KRG Directorate of Yezidi Affairs Yezidis had escaped ISIS as of March including women and children.
The women and girls need trauma support and ongoing counselling Human Rights Watch said. Not all had immediate access to treatment for injuries emergency contraception safe and legal abortion services including sexual and reproductive health access and psychosocial support.
KRG authorities should try to close gaps in medical care and psychosocial support for the Yezidi girls and women and ensure that doctors provide survivors with results of tests they undergo and information on the services available to them Human Rights Watch said. The KRG should also develop a plan to assist children born from rape to ensure adequate services and protection for them and their mothers. In addition the KRG should invest in employment skills training and livelihood schemes to help reintegrate women into daily life.
Yezidi women and girls who escaped ISIS still face enormous challenges and continuing trauma from their experience Gerntholtz said. They need urgent help and support to recover their health and move on with their lives.
Since ISIS attacks in and around Sinjar began on August more than Iraqis primarily Yezidis and other religious minorities fled their homes in Nineveh province most to the semiautonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan according to the International Organization for Migration. ISIS fighters executed hundreds of male Yezidi civilians and then abducted their relatives theUnited Nationsand local and international human rightsorganizationsreported. A recent UN report stated that further investigation is needed to establish the number of those held captive or killed by ISIS which is estimated to be in the thousands.
Although several hundred Yezidis have since escaped according to KRG officials many are still in captivity in various parts of Iraq and Syria. Escaped abductees that Human Rights Watch interviewed said ISIS is holding Yezidis in multiple locations across northern Iraq including Mosul Tal Afar Tal Banat Baaj Rambusi and Sinjar and in areas it controls in eastern Syria including Raqqa and Rabia. They said that ISIS is holding female captives including girls in houses hotels factories farm compounds schools prisons military bases and former government offices.
Young women and girls told Human Rights Watch that ISIS fighters first separated them from men and boys and older women. The fighters moved the women and girls several times in an organized and methodical fashion to various places in Iraq and Syria. While most of the ISIS fighters appeared to be Syrian or Iraqi survivors said that some of their abusers told them that they came from other countries in the Middle East and North Africa including from Libya Algeria Saudi Arabia and the Occupied Palestinian Territories as well as from Europe and Central Asia.
The precise number of Yezidis still captive is unknown because of continuing fighting in Iraq and Syria and because significant numbers of Yezidis fled to areas across Iraq and neighboring countries when ISIS attacked. On March the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated in its report that about people mainly Yezidis allegedly remain in ISIS captivity. Local officials service providers and community activists estimate that the number of Yezidis still held is much higher.
In September a Yezidi group provided Human Rights Watch with a database with names and ages of Yezidis they said ISIS had kidnapped or killed or who had been missing since the ISIS assaults of early August. The database was based on interviews with displaced Yezidis in Iraqi Kurdistan. The group said that as of late March the number of dead abducted and missing Yezidis had risen to .
The women and girls who spoke to Human Rights Watch described repeated rape sexual violence and other abuse in ISIS captivity.
The men would come and select us. When they came they would tell us to stand up and then examine our bodies. They would tell us to show our hair and sometimes they beat the girls if they refused. They wore dishdashas ankle length garments and had long beards and hair.
She said that the ISIS fighter who selected her slapped her and dragged her out of the house when she resisted. I told him not to touch me and begged him to let me go she said. I told him to take me to my mother. I was a young girl and I asked him What do you want from me He spent three days having sex with me.
Another yearold Wafa told Human Rights Watch that in August ISIS fighters abducted her with her family from the village of Kocho. The men took the family to a school in Tal Afar filled with other Yezidi captives where the fighters separated her from her family. From there they took her to several locations within Iraq and then to Raqqa in Syria. An older fighter assured Wafa that she would not be harmed but he repeatedly raped her nevertheless she said.
He was sleeping in the same place with me and told me not be afraid because I was like his daughter she said. One day I woke up and my legs were covered in blood. Wafa escaped three months after her abduction but her parents three brothers and sister are still missing.
The women and girls who said that they had not been raped said they endured constant stress and anxiety when witnessing the suffering of other women fearing they would be next.
Two sisters Rana and Sara said they could do nothing to stop the abuse of their yearold sister by four men over several months. The sister was allowed to visit them and told them that the first man who raped her whom she described as a European also beat her handcuffed her gave her electric shocks and denied her food. She told them another fighter later raped her for a month and then gave her to an Algerian for another month. The last time they saw her was when a Saudi ISIS fighter took her. We dont know anything about her since Sara said. The two sisters said they were also raped multiple times by two men one of whom said he was from Russia and the other from Kazakhstan.
Some women and girls told Human Rights Watch that ISIS fighters beat them if they resisted or defied them in any way.
Zara said that ISIS fighters accused her and two other girls of desecrating a Quran while holding the girls captive on a farm. They punished the three of us by taking us to the garden and tying our hands with wire she said. We were blindfolded and they said they would kill us if we didnt say who had done this. They beat us for minutes and they fired a bullet in the air.
Women and girls told Human Rights Watch that ISIS fighters told them they had been bought for as much as US from other ISIS members.
In some instances ISIS fighters forcibly married their Yezidi captives rather than buy them. Narin said that when a fighter named Abu Duad brought her to his home his wife left in protest. He brought a religious judge to perform a marriage ceremony but Narin refused to participate. Abu Duad persisted by trying to get permission from Narins family and called her brother in Germany. But my brother said no to the marriage and offered to pay for my release Narin said. Abu Duad said no.
Nadia said she was separated from the men in her family when ISIS fighters abducted them in her village near Sinjar in August. She tried to convince the ISIS fighters that she was married to escape being raped because she had heard that ISIS fighters preferred virgins. However after they took her to Syria one of the men said that he would marry her. The other girls with me said its forbidden to marry married women Nadia said. He replied But not if they are Yezidi women.
After capture the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to the sharia amongst the fighters of the Islamic State who participated in the Sinjar operations after one fifth of the slaves were transferred to the Islamic States authority to be divided as khums a tax on war spoils.
It is permissible to buy sell or give as a gift female captives and slaves for they are merely property which can be disposed of. It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasnt reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse however if she is not fit for intercourse then it is enough to enjoy her without intercourse. It is permissible to beat the female slave as a form of darb tadeeb disciplinary beating.
The women and girls who spoke to Human Rights Watch described their own suicide attempts or attempts of others as a way to avoid rape forced marriage or forced religious conversion. They described cutting their wrists with glass or razors attempting to hang themselves trying to electrocute themselves in bathtubs and consuming what they thought was poison.
Later that day they ISIS fighters made a lottery of our names and started to choose women by drawing out the names. The man who selected me Abu Ghufran forced me to bathe but while I was in the bathroom I tried to kill myself. I had found some poison in the house and took it with me to the bathroom. I knew it was toxic because of its smell. I distributed it to the rest of the girls and we each mixed some with water in the bathroom and drank it. None of us died but we all got sick. Some collapsed.
I went into the bathroom turned on the water stood on a chair to take the wire connecting the light to electrocute myself but there was no electricity. After they realized what I was doing they beat me with a long piece of wood and with their fists. My eyes were swollen shut and my arms turned blue. They handcuffed me to the sink and cut my clothes with a knife and washed me. They took me out of the bathroom brought in my friend and raped her in the room in front of me.
Leila said she was later raped. She said she tried to commit suicide again and showed Human Rights Watch the scars on her wrists where she cut herself with a razor.
When they came to select the girls they would pull them away. The girls would cry and faint they would have to take them by force. They made us convert to Islam and we all had to say the shahada Islamic creed. They said You Yezidis are kufar infidels you must repeat these words after the leader. They gathered us all in one place and made us repeat after him. After we said the shahada he said you have now been converted to our religion and our religion is the correct one. We didnt dare not say the shahada.
ISIS fighters held Noor in various places including Mosul. The leader of this group asked us to convert to Islam and read the Quran she said. We were forced to read the Quran and we started to pray slowly. We started to behave like actors.
Rape and other forms of sexual violence sexual slavery cruel treatment and other abuses committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war. International criminal courts have ruled that rape and other sexual violence may also amount to torture.
Those who commit serious violations of the laws of war with criminal intent are responsible for war crimes. Commanders and civilian leaders may be prosecuted for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility when they knew or should have known about the commission of war crimes and took insufficient measures to prevent them or punish those responsible.
The mass rape and other serious abuses by ISIS against Yezidi civilians may be crimes against humanity. Crimes against humanity are serious offenses including rape sexual slavery enslavement unlawful imprisonment persecution of a religious group and other inhumane acts intentionally causing great suffering that are part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population.
Widespread refers to the scale of the acts or the number of victims. Systematic concerns a pattern or methodical plan. ISIS public statements concerning enslavement forced marriage and abuse of captured women as well as the organized sale of Yezidi women and girls indicate a widespread practice and a systematic plan of action by ISIS.
KRG authorities have made significant efforts to provide health and other services to Yezidi women and girls and have designated a health committee in Dohuk to coordinate the identification and referral of survivors to services. The director general for health in Dohuk Dr. Nezhar Ismet Taib who heads the committee said that some families do not wish to reveal that their female relatives were abducted and this has made it difficult for the committee to identify and support those in need.
Almost all of the women and girls who spoke to Human Rights Watch said they had received medical examinations. A local doctor said the medical tests included blood tests for sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. In some cases medical workers provided emergency contraception and postexposure prophylaxis for HIV as recommended by the World Health Organization.
I wasnt raped the ISIS member didnt touch me because I told him I was sick. I got a forensic gynecological exam in Dohuk which cleared me of abuse. I wasnt comfortable during this exam and the doctor didnt explain what she was doing to me beforehand.
Those who take the medical tests do not always receive the test results. The two sisters Rana and Sara said that they spent five months in ISIS captivity and that ISIS fighters raped them multiples times. They said that soon after they escaped in December they received medical treatment and tests but six weeks later they had still not received any test results.Eighteenyearold Arwa from Kocho managed to escape in December after ISIS fighters raped her. She told Human Rights Watch that she was still waiting for her test results seven weeks later.
Local authorities should ensure that health workers inform women and girls of the purpose of each test and that they consent to each procedure. The World Health Organization has provided guidelines for carrying out such tests and obtaining informed consent.
Withholding test results whether positive or negative can compound womens and girls fears about the state of their health. Health workers should ensure that there is follow up for such women and girls including providing test results and any further treatment and information they need.
Psychosocial support for women and girls who escaped ISIS is a crucial service that is largely lacking in Iraqi Kurdistan. All the women and girls interviewed showed signs of trauma. Jalila the yearold raped by four ISIS fighters said she cant sleep at night because I remember how they were raping me. I want to do something to forget about my psychological problems. I want to leave Iraq until things get better I dont want to be captured again. She had not received professional counselling.
Sixteenyearold Noor told Human Rights Watch that ISIS fighters abducted her on August from Tal Afar and held her until September when she escaped. An ISIS fighter raped her multiple times over a period of five days she said. In the first two months after her return she said she remained traumatized and cried most of the time.
Noor did manage to get psychosocial support. A local activist arranged for her to visit a psychotherapist in the hospital three or four times and visited her frequently to encourage her to get regular psychosocial counselling. Noor was undergoing regular psychosocial treatment as well as attending a handicrafts course and leaving the camp for social activities with activists from local organizations.
However representatives of international agencies and nongovernmental groups told Human Rights Watch that there was not only a lack of available psychosocial support but also reluctance by the community to accept such help. One activist said that he had to visit girls and their guardians repeatedly to encourage the girls to participate in psychosocial counselling before they would agree.
No one has offered me oneonone counselling of any kind. Id be interested in receiving professional counselling to help me process my experiences if it was available. I have trouble sleeping at night and only sleep a few hours at a time. When I sleep I often see my parents and siblings in front of my eyes especially the image of my brothers being forced to kneel on the road and my mothers face.
International and local groups agreed that there are not enough psychosocial therapists available to the women and girls to meet the need given the number of escaped women and girls and the prospect of more to come.
Dr. Taib told Human Rights Watch that although he was not aware of any suicides of women or girls who had escaped many were suicidal. He said that women and girls who sought treatment with local officials were assessed by a psychologist at the same time they received medical treatment. The health team designated to help Yezidi women and girls has two psychologists and two psychosocial therapists but plans to increase the number of psychosocial therapists to ten. In addition some groups and international agencies are providing psychosocial support. A psychosocial therapist at Jian Centre for Human Rights said she and her colleague had provided support to Yezidi women and girls who had escaped.
In the short term psychologists and social workers particularly those who speak the local Yezidi dialect need training on counselling methods. This should be in addition to recruiting psychosocial therapists to deal with the urgent cases. More efforts are also needed to encourage and educate people who might need the services about how the services can help them.
The KRG has no comprehensive plan for addressing pregnancies or children born from rape. Dr. Taib told Human Rights Watch that the local health committee had agreed that the authorities should protect women who keep their children including providing shelter for them and their children as well as prenatal and maternal health care. In cases where the women do not want to care for their children personal status courts will have to make decisions about the welfare of the child.
Where the childs biological mother and close family relinquish or abandon the child or are unable to provide adequate care the authorities should ensure appropriate alternative care with or through competent local authorities and authorized nongovernmental groups. In cases in which the childs biological mother and close family do not relinquish the child authorities should direct efforts first at enabling the child to remain in the mothers care or when appropriate the care of other close family members unless it is not in the childs best interests. If women do choose to raise the children there should be a plan for providing them with assistance including psychosocial and financial support.
Officials should ensure that information about services is available to women and girls and can be accessed confidentially.
Abortion is illegal in Iraq. Local officials told Human Rights Watch that it is not permitted in the Kurdistan region even for rape cases unless a doctor considers it a medical necessity such as a risk to the mothers life. The KRG should urgently clarify for healthcare providers the circumstances in which they may legally perform abortions for women and girls who have escaped from ISIS captivity including for women and girls at risk of suicide or honorrelated violence. The Iraqi government should also urgently consider amending the penal code to allow safe and legal abortions for women and girls who have experienced sexual violence.
In addition KRG officials should encourage religious and community leaders to welcome children born from rape if the mothers freely choose to raise them in the Yezidi community and to provide the social support the women need.
These survivors remain pure Yezidis and no one may injure their Yezidi faith because they were subjected to a matter outside their control. We therefore call on everyone to cooperate with and support these victims so that they may again live their normal lives and integrate into society.
These statements appear to have helped protect Yezidi women and girls from harm and have encouraged their families to seek treatment for them.
Ismail Ali the KRG director general for combatting violence against women in Dohuk told Human Rights Watch that officials were not aware of any Yezidi girl or woman at risk from her family since returning but should there be such cases a shelter is available for them. In addition authorities should provide programs that guarantee longterm rehabilitation and housing solutions for all women victims of violence who do not have the support of their families or who are under threat and training for officials local activists and social and health workers to identify cases of women who are at risk of violence from their families. The authorities should also in coordination with religious and community officials raise awareness and provide education particularly for men and boys to prevent violence against women.
In addition investment in skills training and livelihood schemes would help to reintegrate women into daily life. One organization is providing sewing and artsandcrafts courses in the camps.
Many women and girls said that they wanted jobs so that they could financially assist their families. They also said that having nothing to do in the camps and being surrounded by family members who are also traumatized increased or exacerbated their own trauma.
Arwa an yearold from Kocho said What I want more than anything is to work so I can keep my mind off everything that happened.
The Association for Crisis Assistance and Development Cooperation WADI a GermanIraqi nongovernmental organization is seeking funding to build a center where Yezidi women and girls can get skills training. Women and girls who escaped ISIS told Human Rights Watch that they would use such a facility. WADI case workers have taken some of these women and girls out of the camps for social activities which appeared to help occupy them and provide a semblance of a normal life.

Two more persons including a woman were arrested on Friday for alleged rape and extortion involving a model taking the number of those held to eight three of them policemen and all the accused were sent to police custody by a local court.
They were produced before a local court which remanded them in police custody till April . Six of them including the policemen were arrested on Thursday.
On April some of the accused stopped the vehicle of the yearold victim and took her to a nearby police post. There one of the policemen allegedly assaulted her sexuallyand also snatched around Rs . lakh cash from her the crime branch told the court during the remand application hearing.
The prosecution said the custodial interrogation of the accused was necessary to find out if more persons are involved in the case and also to recover the money forcibly taken from the model.
Defence lawyers told the court that their clients werebeing falsely implicated and they were going to seek action against the model under Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act.
The accused were identified as Sunil Katape Suresh Suryavanshi and Yogesh Ponde all policemen Javed Sheikh SanjayRange Tanvir Hashmi Ayesha Malviya and Abrahim Khan.
All have been booked under Indian Penal Code sections related to rape criminal conspiracy and extortion. The victim had sent an SMS to Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria on April complaining about her alleged sexual exploitation by some men including the three policemen.
Maria then called her to his office and after hearing her forwarded the complaint to MIDC police station following which a case was registered.
Since extortion part has been corroborated with the complaint filed by the victim our efforts are on to retrieve the extorted money Deputy Commissioner of Police DhananjayKulkarni said adding they were also trying to verify the allegations levelled by the model.

On Tuesday night at a speech in St. Clairsville Ohio Donald Trump used some harsh words to describe the TransPacific Partnership. The TransPacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country he said. Just a continuing rape of our country. Thats what it is too. Its a harsh word. Its a rape of our country. This is not the first time Trump used terrible rape metaphor. In a speech about China in May Trump said We cant continue to allow China to rape our country. And thats what theyre doing. Its the greatest theft in the history of the world.
As the Intercept pointed out Trump has a particular fondness for using the word rape to demonize his political targets. He is not alone however in making horribly offensive rape comparisons. A few weeks ago Bollywood actor Salman Khan drew outrage from feminists when he compared preparation of his role as a professional wrestler to being repeatedly raped. During those six hours of shooting thered be so much of lifting and thrusting on the ground involved. That is the most difficult thing he said. When I used to walk out of that ring it used to be like a raped woman walking out. Two years ago actress Charlize Theron drew criticism for comparing the invasiveness of the press to feeling raped. In actor Johnny Depp apologized when he compared photo shoots to rape in an interview with Vanity Fair. You just feel like youre being raped somehow he said. Raped. It feels like a kind of weird. just weird man. Increasingly high schoolers are using the word rape to casually describe challenging tests.
The impulse behind making these metaphors is to highlight how awful an experience is through hyperbole and exaggeration. But rape is not a colorful substitute for something thats feels unpleasant or exploitative. Rape has a very specific meaning according to the FBI rape is def Penetration no matter how slight of the vagina oranus with any body part or object or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person withoutthe consent of the victim. And like rape jokes that mock victims and make light of a violent crime these comments that use it to mean something else almost always betray a lack of understanding and empathy around sexual assault and further trivialize a crime thats already so overlooked in society.
We live in a world where mainstream magazines like Mens Fitness publish guides about how no secretly means yes when athletes at private elite colleges spend just three months in jail for brutally assaulting an unconscious woman because a judge is worried for the boys future where police interrogate and dismiss victims of sexual assault where media outlets focus on what a victim drinking and doing instead of the alleged attackers behavior and where victims who come forward with claims are promptly slutshamed and victimblamed and harassed and told to stop partying or drinking or staying out late. All these things show how we diminish rape and when people use language about rape so casually its just further proof that our society doesnt take this crime seriously or understand the lifealtering trauma it can cause. As Blogger Tilly Grove eloquently stated The word rape is used everywhere to mean things that arent rape or anything like it but its nearimpossible to get people to talk about rape when it happens.Clearly rape means everything except for what it is sex without informed consent and people would rather ignore its occurrence and prevalence than acknowledge it as the widespread every day reality that it is.
If you are able to compare really crappy stuff to rape you are fortunate enough to have probably never experienced sexual assault. But remember that one out of six American women has been a victim of rape or attempted rape in her lifetime and . percent of rapists go unpunished. So next time you want to say you raped a test or say another nation is raping America please dont. It only adds the the many overwhelming obstacles that rape victims have to overcome.

She is known to the world only as Indias Daughter following her sickening gang rape and murder . 
I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter.
We interviewed Badri and his family in his ancestral village of Billia in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
They have retreated there to grieve away from their Delhi home a place that will constantly remind them of the barbaric sexual attack Jyoti was subjected to when she and a male friend were lured on to a bus . 
Death for all six of them. These men are beasts. They should be made an example of and that society will not allow such things to happen.
His wife was worried after Jyoti a medical school graduate had not returned home from the cinema.
Then at .pm we got a call from the hospital in Delhi telling me my daughter had been in an accident.
I put my hand on her forehead and called her name. She slowly opened her eyes and started crying and said she was in pain.
I held my tears. I told her not to worry have strength and everything will be all right.
At the time Badri still didnt know what had happened. A policeman finally explained. Jyoti and her friend Awindra Pandey had boarded a bus to get home but had been taken on a twoandahalf hour ride to hell by the driver his assistant and four passengers.
Both were battered with iron bars and Jyoti was repeatedly raped before they were stripped and dumped on a road leading to Delhi airport yards from where Badri was working.
But she did write on some paper that she wanted to live she wanted to survive and stay with us. But it was fate that had the last say in the end.
Jyoti gave the police two statements but Badri was too distraught to sit in as he couldnt listen to what his daughter had been subjected to.
Five men have been formally charged with the murder kidnap and gang rape of Jyoti
My wife was with her through the statements but she cried so much after hearing it all Badri said.
She then told me what happened. I dont have the words to describe the incident. All I can say is theyre not human not even animals. Theyre not of this world.
It was just gruesome and I hope no one ever goes through what she had to endure.
She cried a lot she was in a lot of pain. And as soon as she saw her mother and brothers she cried again.
But after that she was a courageous girl even trying to console us and give us hope that everything will be all right.
Doctors were forced to remove Jyotis intestines and as her conditioned worsened they flew her to Singapore for specialist care on Boxing Day.
I put my hand on her forehead she asked me if Id had any dinner and then she gestured for me to go to sleep. I held her hand and kissed it. I told her to take rest and not to worry and she closed her eyes.
Jyoti was moved to Mount Elizabeth Hospital for medical treatment before her death
As Jyoti battled for life thousands took to the streets to demand the hanging of the six accused and a new antirape law. But three days later on December she had a fatal heart attack.
Were so devastated that shes gone. Theres a huge void in our lives. She was the centre of our universe. Our lives revolved around her.
Badri said Jyotis friend Awindra was not her boyfriend just a very brave friend who tried to save her.
She never expressed a desire to marry. She was concentrating on her studies and wanted a job first.
Badri also revealed that Jyoti often mentioned how much Awindra tried to save her.
She kept telling her mother he tried his best to help but they kept beating him with a rod.
Badri now cherishes the memories of his daughter. He remembers her dream of being a doctor.
When Badri first moved to Delhi in he earned just Rupees a month the equivalent of . today.
But he sold some land to pay for his daughters studies and saved as much as possible from his Rupees a month he now earns.
Jyoti had only just finished her fouryear course in physiotherapy at college outside Delhi. She was doing an internship when she was attacked.
Her brothers Gaurav Singh and Saurav Singh were close to their big sister and cannot image how they will cope.
Badri and all the family have been touched by the way the nation has supported them.
I used to read about rape incidents in the newspapers but never digested it much. Were so thankful to the people who came out to protest against the barbarity.
DNA tests have linked five men and a yearold from the bus with rape and murder. The men will appear at the District Court in the Saket area of the Indian capital tomorrow . The yearold will be tried separately as a juvenile. 
Badris face lit up when he spoke of Jyotis dreams and invited us to look through his family album. Each photo showed his beautiful daughter smiling. In most she is wears western clothes which she favoured over the traditional sari. She also always wore her long dark shiny hair down and flowing never tied up.
Indian law prohibits naming a rape victim unless she authorises it or if she is dead her family agrees to it.
At the moment it is enough for the devastated family to sanction the release to the world of their precious daughters name. And they hope a hospital will one day be named in her honour . 
Awindra Pandrey said the the vehicle had tinted windows and curtains to hide the attack
Six men face the death penalty after being charged with murder over the crime that shocked the world

The opportunistic rape and pillage of previous centuries has been replaced in modern conflict by rape used as an orchestrated combat tool.
And while Amnesty cites ongoing conflicts in Colombia Iraq Sudan Chechnya Nepal and Afghanistan the use of rape as a weapon of war goes back much further.
From the systematic rape of women in Bosnia to an estimated women raped during the battle for Bangladeshi independence in to Japanese rapes during the occupation of Nanking the past century offers too many examples.
So what motivates armed forces whether statebacked troops or irregular militia to attack civilian women and children
Gita Sahgal of Amnesty International told the BBC News website it was a mistake to think such assaults were primarily about the ageold spoils of war or sexual gratification.
Rape is often used in ethnic conflicts as a way for attackers to perpetuate their social control and redraw ethnic boundaries she said.
Therefore if one group wants to control another they often do it by impregnating women of the other community because they see it as a way of destroying the opposing community.
A report by Medecins Sans Frontieres says it first came across rape as a weapon in the s.
In Bosnia systematic rape was used as part of the strategy of ethnic cleansing it said.
The same tactic was used in a very strategic attack by statebacked Pakistani troops during the fight for Bangladeshs independence in Ms Sahgal said.
They were saying we will make you breed Punjabi children she said with the aim of weakening the integrity of the opposing ethnic group.
Amnesty this year accused the progovernment Janjaweed militias in Sudans Darfur region of using mass rape in order to punish humiliate and control nonArab groups.
Such attacks cause women and children to flee their homes lead to fragmentation of communities and bring the risk of infection with HIVAids.
Sexual violence is also used to destabilise communities and sow terror Amnesty says in its Lives Blown Apart report.
In Colombia rival groups rape mutilate and kill women and girls in order to impose punitive codes of conduct on entire towns and villages so strengthening their control.
The strategic use of rape in war is not a new phenomenon but only recently has it begun to be documented chiefly in the Democratic Republic of Congo Colombia and Sudan said Ms Sahgal.
And even after conflicts are resolved few countries seem willing to tackle what is often seen as a crime against individual women rather than a strategy of war.
In many nations the collapse of the rule of law leaves them unable to deal with allegations of rape while in others women feel too exposed to stigma to accuse their attackers.
International courts have tackled some cases in Bosnia where Muslim women were forced into sexual slavery in the town of Foca in the s and in Rwanda but the vast majority of perpetrators act with impunity.
Representatives of the comfort women forcibly drafted into military sexual slavery by Japan from until the end of World War II are still fighting for restitution.
Far from colluding women from Korea China Taiwan the Philippines Malaysia and East Timor were severely coerced into prostitution says Ms Sahgal.
And whether a woman is raped at gunpoint or trafficked into sexual slavery by an occupying force the sexual abuse will shape not just her own but her communitys future for years to come.
Survivors face emotional torment psychological damage physical injuries disease social ostracism and many other consequences that can devastate their lives says Amnesty.
Womens lives and their bodies have been the unacknowledged casualties of war for too long.
The yearold physiotherapy student who was gangraped on a moving bus in New Delhi on December died at Mount Elizabeth Hospital here in the early hours of Saturday. The body arrived in Delhi in the early hours of Sunday.

Sky News has carried out a survey of mens attitudes towards rape in South Africa. Their answers are both candid and shocking.
Sky News went to a township near Johannesburg to do our own impromptu survey asking men whether they had ever forced a woman to have sex.
The survey was commissioned with a small team of researchers who asked a select number of questions.
In total out of the that answered said they had raped a woman and many even explained how and why.
The most graphic content has been removed but those likely to be offended by such material should not read on.
Living under a constant fear of rape and abuse at the brothels of Iraq and Syria the captured Yazidi women say they would rather embrace death than a life like this. A young woman reportedly held by ISIS militants spoke toactivists working with CompassionKurdistan over telephone andbegged them to ask the West to bomb her location.
The unidentified woman is a prisoner of the ISIS jihadists who have kept her as a sex slave along with several other women in Iraq. A Daily Mailreport claimed that the unidentified woman was among the hundreds who were captured by ISIS during the Sinjar massacre in early August.
CompassionKurdistan which works on raising awareness of ISIS persecution of women in Iraq and Syria told BBC World Servicehow the Yazidi women plead for the brothel to be bombed as that would end their misery.
For the Islamic State militants who belong to the Sunni sect of Muslims the Yazidis are nothing but devil worshippers and hence killing and abusing them does not count as wrong at all. Reports have found that the ISIS operates brothels in Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq.
It has been found that thousands of kidnapped Yazidi women who are held in these Islamic States brothels are being managed by top British female jihadists who are tasked with maintaining the ISIS brothels and disciplining the women.
Over the phone the young Yazidi women alleged she was raped dozens of times. If you know where we are please bomb us. There is no life after this. Im going to kill myself anyway some have killed themselves this morning she was quoted as saying.
Ive been raped times and its not even lunchtime. I cant go to the toilet. Please bomb us the Yazidi woman begged over the telephone.
Reports have found that in the ISIS slave markets the captured stock women girls and young boys are even forced to carry price tags.
In the past several Yazidi women have ended their lives by jumping off cliffs during the capture of Sinjar mountain by ISIS. My daughters were calling on people to kill them but no one wanted to do that. So they jumped from the mountain and ended their bitter life the mother of girls had told a local news source.
United Nations which has called the persecution of the Yazidi community by ISIS an attempt to commit genocide in a statement earlier this month condemned the explicit targeting of women and children and the barbaric acts the Islamic State has perpetrated on minorities in areas under its control.
We remind all armed groups that acts of sexual violence are grave human rights violations that can be considered as war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Recently the CompassionKurdistan group also staged a mock sex slave market in London to raise awareness on the situation of Yazidis in Iraq.
Angry crowds have gathered in Indias capital New Delhi accusing police of failing to act over the rape of a toddler.
Police say two children a twoyearold and a fiveyearold have been raped in separate attacks in the city in the latest incidents of sexual violence against girls and women in the country.
The twoandahalfyearold girl was abducted from a religious event in west Delhi by two men on Friday night and raped before being dumped in a park near her home relatives and police said.
Family members found the child lying unconscious and bleeding in a park three hours after she went missing during a power outage in the neighbourhood.
Police said on Saturday that they were questioning three men who were arrested in the gang rape of the fiveyearold.
The incidents come one week after a fouryearold girl was allegedly raped and slashed with a blade before being abandoned by a railway track in the capital.
Police arrested a yearold man over that attack in which the young girl suffered severe internal injuries and had apparently been slashed with a sharp object.
The attacks add to a grim catalogue of sexual assaults in India many of which have sparked domestic and international outrage.
The fatal gang rape of a young student on a bus in Delhi in led to an outpouring of anger over frightening levels of violence against women.
India recorded rape cases in with of them in Delhi. Experts say those figures likely underrepresent the true scale of the crimes
Still Sanam Naraghi Anderlini executive director of the International Civil Society Action Network told Al Jazeera that the womens movement in India have been successful in bringing international attention to the number of sexual assaults in the country.
I think as much as we might say that the levels of sexual assault have gone up it may well be that its the reporting of these assaults that have increased and thats in large part because of the womens movements in India Anderlini said.
But we also need to recognise when these assaults are new forms of violence against women and specifically violence against girls and children.

Much has been written and said about the Stanford sexual assault case in which the attacker got off with a light sentence. What stood out in this whole incident however was the grit of the girl. The fact that she decided to let her ordeal be known to the public via a powerful letter. That she had the support of her family and society in doing so.
The Nirbhaya case was a pivotal moment in the continuing evolution of Indian society. The only positive thing that has come out of this tragedy is that sexual violence which is actually a global issue took centre stage in Indian public discourse.

She is known to the world only as Indias Daughter following her sickening gang rape and murder . 
I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter.
We interviewed Badri and his family in his ancestral village of Billia in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
They have retreated there to grieve away from their Delhi home a place that will constantly remind them of the barbaric sexual attack Jyoti was subjected to when she and a male friend were lured on to a bus . 
Death for all six of them. These men are beasts. They should be made an example of and that society will not allow such things to happen.
His wife was worried after Jyoti a medical school graduate had not returned home from the cinema.
Then at .pm we got a call from the hospital in Delhi telling me my daughter had been in an accident.
I put my hand on her forehead and called her name. She slowly opened her eyes and started crying and said she was in pain.
I held my tears. I told her not to worry have strength and everything will be all right.
At the time Badri still didnt know what had happened. A policeman finally explained. Jyoti and her friend Awindra Pandey had boarded a bus to get home but had been taken on a twoandahalf hour ride to hell by the driver his assistant and four passengers.
Both were battered with iron bars and Jyoti was repeatedly raped before they were stripped and dumped on a road leading to Delhi airport yards from where Badri was working.
But she did write on some paper that she wanted to live she wanted to survive and stay with us. But it was fate that had the last say in the end.
Jyoti gave the police two statements but Badri was too distraught to sit in as he couldnt listen to what his daughter had been subjected to.
Five men have been formally charged with the murder kidnap and gang rape of Jyoti
My wife was with her through the statements but she cried so much after hearing it all Badri said.
She then told me what happened. I dont have the words to describe the incident. All I can say is theyre not human not even animals. Theyre not of this world.
It was just gruesome and I hope no one ever goes through what she had to endure.
She cried a lot she was in a lot of pain. And as soon as she saw her mother and brothers she cried again.
But after that she was a courageous girl even trying to console us and give us hope that everything will be all right.
Doctors were forced to remove Jyotis intestines and as her conditioned worsened they flew her to Singapore for specialist care on Boxing Day.
I put my hand on her forehead she asked me if Id had any dinner and then she gestured for me to go to sleep. I held her hand and kissed it. I told her to take rest and not to worry and she closed her eyes.
Jyoti was moved to Mount Elizabeth Hospital for medical treatment before her death
As Jyoti battled for life thousands took to the streets to demand the hanging of the six accused and a new antirape law. But three days later on December she had a fatal heart attack.
Were so devastated that shes gone. Theres a huge void in our lives. She was the centre of our universe. Our lives revolved around her.
Badri said Jyotis friend Awindra was not her boyfriend just a very brave friend who tried to save her.
She never expressed a desire to marry. She was concentrating on her studies and wanted a job first.
Badri also revealed that Jyoti often mentioned how much Awindra tried to save her.
She kept telling her mother he tried his best to help but they kept beating him with a rod.
Badri now cherishes the memories of his daughter. He remembers her dream of being a doctor.
When Badri first moved to Delhi in he earned just Rupees a month the equivalent of . today.
But he sold some land to pay for his daughters studies and saved as much as possible from his Rupees a month he now earns.
Jyoti had only just finished her fouryear course in physiotherapy at college outside Delhi. She was doing an internship when she was attacked.
Her brothers Gaurav Singh and Saurav Singh were close to their big sister and cannot image how they will cope.
Badri and all the family have been touched by the way the nation has supported them.
I used to read about rape incidents in the newspapers but never digested it much. Were so thankful to the people who came out to protest against the barbarity.
DNA tests have linked five men and a yearold from the bus with rape and murder. The men will appear at the District Court in the Saket area of the Indian capital tomorrow . The yearold will be tried separately as a juvenile. 
Badris face lit up when he spoke of Jyotis dreams and invited us to look through his family album. Each photo showed his beautiful daughter smiling. In most she is wears western clothes which she favoured over the traditional sari. She also always wore her long dark shiny hair down and flowing never tied up.
Indian law prohibits naming a rape victim unless she authorises it or if she is dead her family agrees to it.
At the moment it is enough for the devastated family to sanction the release to the world of their precious daughters name. And they hope a hospital will one day be named in her honour . 
Awindra Pandrey said the the vehicle had tinted windows and curtains to hide the attack
Six men face the death penalty after being charged with murder over the crime that shocked the world
Writing in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine Dr. Felicia H. Stewart and Dr. James Trussell have estimated that there are twentyfive thousand raperelated pregnancies each year in the United States. While these numbers make up only a small part of this countrys annual three million unwanted pregnancies the numbers are still extremely high. Nonetheless the relationship between rape and pregnancy has been a topic of highly politicized debate since long before Todd Akins comments on legitimate rape Paul Ryans bill with its category of forcible rape and Sharron Angles suggestion two years ago that women pregnant through rape make a lemon situation into lemonade. There is a veritable war of statistics about rape and pregnancy and the confusion is exacerbated by the competing agendas of the prochoice and antiabortion movements. It has been argued that fear promotes ovulation and that women who are raped have a tenpercent risk of pregnancy there are estimates of as little as one per cent. Numbers are also skewed when they are adjusted to include or exclude women not of reproductive age for sodomy and other forms of rape that cannot cause pregnancy for rape victims who may be using oral birth control or I.U.D.s and for women who are raped and become or are pregnant as a result of consensual sex with a husband or partner who is not the rapist before or after the rape. Women who are being abused on an ongoing basis are particularly likely to conceive in rape. Catherine MacKinnon has written Forced pregnancy is familiar beginning in rape and proceeding through the denial of abortions this occurred during slavery and still happens to women who cannot afford abortions. 
I have been researching a book Far from the Tree that deals in part with women raising children conceived in rape and have therefore met the living reproof to Akins remark. Life for these children may be extremely difficult. One of the few groups founded to address this population Stigma Inc. took as its motto Rape survivors are the victims their children are the forgotten victims. 
And yet theres a lot of history behind their experience and that of their mothers. Augustine saw a noble purpose in rape while promising women that savage lust perpetuated against them will be punished he also praises rape for keeping women humble letting them know whether previously they were arrogant with regard to their virginity or overfond of praise or whether they would have become proud had they not suffered violation. The Roman physician Galen claimed that women could not conceive in rapecould not in fact conceive without an orgasm based in pleasure and consent. Classical mythology is full of rape usually seen as a positive event for the rapist who is often a god Zeus so took Europa and Leda Dionysus raped Aura Poseidon Aethra Apollo Euadne. It is noteworthy that every one of these rapes produces children. The rape of a vestal virgin by Mars produced Romulus and Remus who founded Rome. Romulus organized the rape of the Sabine women to populate his new city. In much later civilizations the rape of the Sabines was considered a noble story in the Renaissance it often graced marriage chests. The hostility such children inspired due to their origins has also long been acknowledged. In both the ancient and the medieval world women who bore children conceived in rape were permitted to let them die of exposurealthough in medieval Europe a few weeks penance was deemed necessary for doing so. 
Historically rape has been seen less as a violation of a woman than as a theft from a man to whom that woman belonged either her husband or her father who suffered an economic loss a womans marriageability spoiled and an insult to his honor. There was also the problem of bastard children who were considered a social burden the Athenian state for example was primarily occupied with protecting bloodlines and so treated rape and adultery the same way. Hammurabis code describes rape victims as adulterers English law of the seventeenth century takes a similar position. In Puritan Massachusetts any woman pregnant through rape was prosecuted for fornication. In the nineteenth century the American courts remained biased toward protecting men who might be falsely accused. In order to prove that an encounter was a rape the woman had to demonstrate that she had resisted and been overcome she usually had to show bodily harm as evidence of her struggle and she had somehow to prove that the man had ejaculated inside her. 
That is to say mentally stable people are not the kind who get raped. The emerging field of psychoanalysis did not help matters. Though Freud himself wrote little about rape Freudians in the early and midtwentieth century saw the rapist as someone suffering a perverse uncontrolled sexual appetite who fed into womens natural masochism. This position seemed to exonerate the rapist in the psychoanalyst Menachem Amir called rape a victimmotivated crime. A rapist was the embodiment of virility while those who were raped were utterly abject the aggression was deplored less than the disenfranchisement was pitied.
For several of the women I interviewed the crisis was exacerbated by the question of what rape means by the idea that some rape is not forcible or legitimate. Men who have gotten away with rape seldom retreat in shame or repentance they often play out their ghoulish exuberance by claiming their reproductive successes. Among the women I interviewed such mens bids for custody or visitation rights felt far more like acts of further aggression than expressions of care. Nevertheless in instances where rape cannot be proven or charges were never filed the threat of joint custody is real. Many women who cannot cope with prosecuting their assailant are then left without any proof of assault. In a time when DNA evidence can establish biological ties scientifically this lack of evidence as to the social circumstances of conception can be a serious problem. Stigma Inc. had a posting that read The fatherrapist is thus deemed ineligible for visitation or custody of the minor child. However as in the case of rape victims in general the burden of proof that a rape took place is often placed upon the woman who has suffered the crime. Often it comes down to a he saidshe said issue. 
Even women who try to learn their childs blamelessness can find it desperately difficult. The British psychoanalyst Joan RaphaelLeff writes of women bearing children conceived in rape The woman feels she has growing inside her part of a hateful or distasteful Other. Unless this feeling can be resolved the ftus who takes on these characteristics is liable to remain an internal foreigner barely tolerated or in constant danger of expulsion and the baby will emerge partstranger likely to be ostracized or punished. One rape survivor in testimony before the Louisiana Senate Committee on Health and Welfare described her son as a living breathing torture mechanism that replayed in my mind over and over the rape. Another woman described having a rapeconceived son as entrapment beyond description and felt the child was cursed from birth the child ultimately had severe psychological challenges and was removed from the family by social services concerned about his mental wellbeing. One of the women I interviewed said While most mothers just go with their natural instincts my instincts are horrifying. Its a constant conscious effort that my instincts not take over.
One sees the problem abroad where the Helms Amendment is taken to mean that no agency receiving U.S. funding can mention abortion even to women who have been systematically raped as part of a genocidal campaign. The journalist Helena Smith wrote the story of a woman named Mirveta who gave birth to a child conceived in rape in Kosovo. Mirveta was twenty years old and illiterate her husband had abandoned her because of the pregnancy. He was a healthy little boy and Mirveta had produced him Smith writes. But birth the fifth in her short lifetime had not brought joy only dread. As he was pulled from her loins as the nurses at Kosovos Britishadministered university hospital handed her the baby as the young Albanian mother took the child she prepared to do the deed. She cradled him to her chest she looked into her boys eyes she stroked his face and she snapped his neck. They say it was a fairly clean business. Mirveta had used her bare hands. It is said that in tears she handed her baby back to the nurses holding his snapped limp neck. In Pristina in her psychiatric detention cell she has been weeping ever since. The aid worker taking care of Mirveta said Who knows She may have looked into the babys face and seen the eyes of the Serb who raped her. She is a victim too. Psychologically raped a second time.

Much has been written and said about the Stanford sexual assault case in which the attacker got off with a light sentence. What stood out in this whole incident however was the grit of the girl. The fact that she decided to let her ordeal be known to the public via a powerful letter. That she had the support of her family and society in doing so.
The Nirbhaya case was a pivotal moment in the continuing evolution of Indian society. The only positive thing that has come out of this tragedy is that sexual violence which is actually a global issue took centre stage in Indian public discourse.

Living under a constant fear of rape and abuse at the brothels of Iraq and Syria the captured Yazidi women say they would rather embrace death than a life like this. A young woman reportedly held by ISIS militants spoke toactivists working with CompassionKurdistan over telephone andbegged them to ask the West to bomb her location.
The unidentified woman is a prisoner of the ISIS jihadists who have kept her as a sex slave along with several other women in Iraq. A Daily Mailreport claimed that the unidentified woman was among the hundreds who were captured by ISIS during the Sinjar massacre in early August.
CompassionKurdistan which works on raising awareness of ISIS persecution of women in Iraq and Syria told BBC World Servicehow the Yazidi women plead for the brothel to be bombed as that would end their misery.
For the Islamic State militants who belong to the Sunni sect of Muslims the Yazidis are nothing but devil worshippers and hence killing and abusing them does not count as wrong at all. Reports have found that the ISIS operates brothels in Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq.
It has been found that thousands of kidnapped Yazidi women who are held in these Islamic States brothels are being managed by top British female jihadists who are tasked with maintaining the ISIS brothels and disciplining the women.
Over the phone the young Yazidi women alleged she was raped dozens of times. If you know where we are please bomb us. There is no life after this. Im going to kill myself anyway some have killed themselves this morning she was quoted as saying.
Ive been raped times and its not even lunchtime. I cant go to the toilet. Please bomb us the Yazidi woman begged over the telephone.
Reports have found that in the ISIS slave markets the captured stock women girls and young boys are even forced to carry price tags.
In the past several Yazidi women have ended their lives by jumping off cliffs during the capture of Sinjar mountain by ISIS. My daughters were calling on people to kill them but no one wanted to do that. So they jumped from the mountain and ended their bitter life the mother of girls had told a local news source.
United Nations which has called the persecution of the Yazidi community by ISIS an attempt to commit genocide in a statement earlier this month condemned the explicit targeting of women and children and the barbaric acts the Islamic State has perpetrated on minorities in areas under its control.
We remind all armed groups that acts of sexual violence are grave human rights violations that can be considered as war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Recently the CompassionKurdistan group also staged a mock sex slave market in London to raise awareness on the situation of Yazidis in Iraq.
The star was feelin herself today after absolutely demolishing a senseless mindless Twitter user when he made an awful and not particularly funny joke about rape in light of the movie Purge the fictional flick in which all laws are lifted.
In March of this year a Dutch woman known only as Laura had a few drinks at a hotel bar in Doha Qatar when she started to experience a weird feeling. She eventually woke up in an unfamiliar location and realized her drink had been spiked and she was raped.
And thats exactly what some Stanford University students did over the weekend using the schools graduation ceremony as their outlet to protest what they believe is the campus protection of rapists as well as lashing out over his light sentence.
Students held up a variety of signs protesting the vexing sentence as well as the colleges lack of security.
Its not enough that convicted Stanford University rapist Brock Turners father decided to write a tonedeaf letter to the court that went viral but now his mom had to go and do the same thing
News reports indicate that Carleen Turner sent a letter off to controversial Judge Aaron Persky asking for leniency in sentencing after her son was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster after a frat party at Stanford.
Judge Aaron Persky is the controversial man at the center of the nowinfamous rape conviction and extremely light sentence handed down on college student Brock Turner.
According to the San Jose Mercury News Persky has faced a significant backlash from potential jurors this week after he sentenced Turner to just six months in prison despite the former Stanford University swimmer being convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster outside a frat party last January.
After Brock Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail after he was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman back in January of last year many are crying out for justice.
Santa Clara Calif. County Judge Aaron Persky handed out an unusually light sixmonth sentence to the former Stanford University swimmer despite sentencing recommendations stating the yearold should face up to years in prison.
The judge cited Turners clean criminal record and wrote that a harsh punishment would leave a severe impact on him which come on hes obviously already left a very severe impact on his victim so how is that overly severe
Now an online petition on Change.org has already garnered nearly signatures in support of having Persky recalled
Kesha has already reacted to her cancelled Billboard Music Awards performance but now its her moms turn to sound off on the controversial call.
On Wednesday Pebe Sebert took to Twitter to call out the people responsible for pulling the plug on her daughters upcoming performance. And believe it or not shes not taking aim at Dr. Luke well not directly.
The yearold went on social media to completely slam the American legal system firing shots at the New York judge who denied the pop star her injunction bid to get out of a contract with her alleged abuser.
In a new interview with Us Weekly not only did she dish all the deets on her relationship with the newly single NBA star his relationship with Iggy Azalea but also her second pregnancy with the athlete

Indians gathered in their thousands in protests and candlelit vigils to mark the death in a Singapore hospital of a woman beaten and gang raped in New Delhi as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh led appeals for calm.
Delhi police will press murder charges against the six men accused of raping the yearold woman and beating her with iron bars in the back of the bus on Dec. spokesman Rajan Bhagat said by phone yesterday. The men may appear in court to be charged as soon as Jan. he said.
Some demonstrators held placards calling for the death penalty for the alleged rapists and improved treatment for women as they congregated in Mumbai Hyderabad and Bangalore. Others braved the cold winters evening in New Delhi to carry candles or meet in quiet prayer. Earlier crowds heckled Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit near parliament in the capital.
The victim attacked in a moving bus passed away peacefully early on Dec. with her family and officials from the High Commission of India at her side according to a statement from Kelvin Loh chief executive officer at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. She had suffered serious injuries to her body and brain he said. An Air India plane carrying her body landed at New Delhi airport early today after a flight from Singapore the Press Trust of India reported.
Police yesterday barricaded roads in New Delhi and closed subway stations to keep control over the swelling crowds and prevent a recurrence of earlier violent demonstrations in the capital. Protests were barred in the capital except at a designated site Bhagat said in televised comments.
We have already seen the emotions and energies this incident has generated Singh said in an emailed statement. It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channel these emotions and energies into a constructive course of action he said. Its up to all Indians to ensure that her death will not have been in vain.
Singh has appointed a retired Delhi High Court judge to investigate the crime and fix lapses in policing. He also pledged to consider tougher penalties for sex crimes after the assault prompted street demonstrations organized through socialmedia postings. The protesters who fought water cannons and tear gas on Dec. and Dec. demanded more be done to protect women in the capital and across India.
The need of the hour is a dispassionate debate and inquiry into the critical changes that are required in societal attitudes Singh said in his statement yesterday.
After tricking the woman and her yearold male friend into boarding the unauthorized chartered bus with dark tinted windows and heavy curtains the crew of the vehicle and accomplices assaulted the two over a period of about minutes stripped them and then threw them out.
The woman a physiotherapy student whose name cant be revealed under Indian laws was flown to Singapore for specialist treatment paid for by the Indian government.
The increased public role of women is accompanied by growing threats to their safety and security the prime minister said on Dec. . We must reflect on this problem which occurs in all states and regions of our country.
Data provided by Indias National Crime Records Bureau show about cases of rape and cases of crimes against women were reported in . United Nations figures show . cases of rape for every in India compared with in Sweden in the U.K. and in the U.S. Most instances of rape go unreported in India.
Singh has vowed to hasten prosecution of the accused. The panel led by the former chief justice of the Supreme Court has been asked to rewrite criminal codes to allow harsher penalties to be imposed including capital punishment in the rarest of rare rape cases.
It typically takes years for ordinary Indians to get justice because of a slowmoving legal process and overburdened courts. Longrunning trials and lax enforcement of laws have also fueled protests in the nations capital. About cases were pending in the Supreme Court as of July of which percent have been on the roll for more than a year government data show.

A yearold woman is critical after being allegedly gangraped by men on the orders of village elders in Indias eastern state of West Bengal reports say.
The elders meted out the rape as punishment for the womans involvement with a man from another community. The men involved in ordering the punishment and in the rape have been arrested reports said.
Its horrific. They rapists are all our neighbours and I call some of them as kaka uncle and some others as dada elder brother or bhai brother said a report in The Hindustan Times newspaper quoting the woman.
The elders who form what is known locally as salishi sabha Greivance Committee spelt out the punishment though they do not have any status under the Indian legal system.
Such illegal kangaroo courts prevail in several parts of rural India and have a reputation for being ultraconservative and ruthless in dealing with anyone who defies social mores and customs.
According to reports on Thursday the rape occurred earlier this week at Subalpur village in Birbhum district some km from the provincial capital Kolkata.
The purported offence was committed when the man from another community was seen at the womans house. The village chief and his associates reportedly asked them to pay a fine of Rs each for the indiscretion.
While the man was able to pay the fine the womans family was unable to do so reports said. The woman on the orders of the kangaroo court was forcibly taken away and reportedly raped through the night before being sent back home the next morning.
The family complained to the police who arrested the and then helped the girl to hospital in a critical condition reports said.
Prima facie she was gangraped and we have rounded up persons said agencies quoting Prashanta Chowdhury Assistant Superintendent of Police.
West Bengal recently witnessed another incident in which a woman was raped twice by the same gang and then set on fire causing a massive uproar across the state.
Some four years earlier in a similar incident a young tribal girl was paraded naked in the same district for her alleged affair with a boy from a different community again sparking huge protests.
The state under the rule of Trinamool Congress an offshoot of the Congress has been in the spotlight for a series of rapes in the last two years. West Bengal topped states in crimes against women in and reports said quoting data from the National Crime Records Bureau.

Why isnt it a crime for a man to rape his wife in India The government says its because of poverty religious beliefs social customs and the mindset of the Indian society among other things.
A federal minister said Wednesday that Indias Bharatiya Janata Partyled government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not plan to introduce punishments for marital rape.
It is considered that the concept of marital rape as understood internationally cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary said in a written statement to Indias upper house of Parliament.
He attributed this to various factors e.g. level of educationilliteracy poverty myriad social customs and values religious beliefs mindset of the society to treat the marriage as a sacrament etc.
Mr. Chaudhury a minister in Indias Ministry of Home Affairs was replying to a member of Parliament who had sought the governments stance on marital rape.
Whether or not to criminalize rape within marriage has long been debated in India. The United Nations has recommended India make it criminal for a man to rape his wife. Criminalizing marital rape was also one of the suggestions of the Verma Committee a threemember panel appointed to strengthen Indias sexualassault laws in the wake of a brutal gang rape in .
The government then led by the Congress party had rejected this proposal. A panel of lawmakers who opposed the move at the time argued it had the potential of destroying the institution of marriage.
If marital rape is brought under the law the entire family system will be under great stress a report submitted by lawmakers to Parliament had said in . The government eventually passed a new sexualassault law which did not criminalize marital rape.
Lawyers and womens rights activists have criticized the decision to leave marital rape out of the penal code.
Many countries have made it a crime for a husband to force his wife to have sex in recent years. Malaysia changed its laws to that effect in Turkey in and Bolivia in . The United States began criminalizing marital rape in s and most European countries in the s.
China Afghanistan Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are some of the countries that do not criminalize marital rape.

NEW DELHISINGAPORE A woman whose gang rape provoked protests and rare national debate about violence against women in India died from her injuries on Saturday prompting promises of action from a government that has struggled to respond to public outrage.
The unidentified yearold medical student suffered a brain injury and massive internal damage in the attack on December and died in hospital in Singapore where she had been taken for treatment.
Protesters rallied peacefully in the capital New Delhi and other cities across India to keep the pressure on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs government to get tougher on crimes against women. That was in contrast to the pitched battles protesters fought with police last weekend.
The six suspects held in connection with the attack on the student on a New Delhi bus were charged with murder following her death police said. The maximum penalty for murder is death.
Authorities worried about the reaction to the news of her death deployed thousands of policemen closed metro stations and banned vehicles from some main roads in the heart of New Delhi where demonstrators have converged since the attack to demand improved womens rights.
Despite efforts to cordon off the city centre more than people gathered at two locations. Some protesters shouted for justice others for the death penalty for the rapists.
Most sex crimes in India go unreported many offenders go unpunished and the wheels of justice turn slowly according to social activists who say that successive governments have done little to ensure the safety of women.
Political leaders vowed steps to correct shameful social attitudes towards women in the worlds biggest democracy.
The need of the hour is a dispassionate debate and inquiry into the critical changes that are required in societal attitudes the prime minister said in a statement.
I hope that the entire political class and civil society will set aside narrow sectional interests and agenda to help us all reach the end that we all desire making India a demonstrably better and safer place for women to live in.
The woman beaten raped and thrown out of a moving bus had been flown to Singapore in a critical condition by the Indian government on Thursday.
She and her male friend were returning home from the cinema media reports say when six men on the bus beat them with metal rods and repeatedly raped the woman. Media said a rod was used in the rape causing internal injuries. The friend survived.
She was courageous in fighting for her life for so long against the odds but the trauma to her body was too severe for her to overcome Kelvin Loh chief executive officer of the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore said in a statement announcing her death from multiple organ failure.
The Indian government has chartered an aircraft to fly her body back to India along with family members T.C.A. Raghavan the Indian high commissioner to Singapore told reporters.
The body was taken from the hospital to a Hindu undertaker in Singapore and hours later lying in a gold and yellow coffin selected by Indian diplomats the body was driven in a hearse to the airport.
The plane took off from Singapore at GMT and was expected to reach New Delhi around a.m. local time on Sunday GMT Saturday the NDTV channel reported on its website citing the High Commissioner.
Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in the northern Indian city of Lucknow. In Hyderabad in southern India a group of women marched to demand severe punishment for the rapists. Protests were also held in the cities of Chennai Kolkata and Mumbai.
For some reason and I dont really know why she got through to us wellknown columnist Nilanjana Roy wrote in a blog on Saturday.
Our words shriveled in the face of what shed been subjected to by the six men travelling on that bus who spent an hour torturing and raping her savagely beating up her male friend.
Sonia Gandhi the powerful leader of the ruling Congress party directly addressed the protesters in a rare broadcast on state television saying that as a mother and a woman she understood their grievances.
Your voice has been heard Gandhi said. It deepens our determination to battle the pervasive and the shameful social attitudes that allow men to rape and molest women with such impunity.
The attack has put gender issues centre stage in Indian politics. Issues such as rape dowryrelated deaths and female infanticide have rarely entered mainstream political discourse.
Analysts say the death of the woman dubbed Amanat an Urdu word meaning treasure by some Indian media could change that although it is too early to say whether the protesters calling for government action to better safeguard women can sustain their momentum through to national elections due in .
The outcry over the attack caught the government offguard and it was slow to react. It took a week for Singh to make a statement on the attack infuriating many protesters who saw it as a sign of a government insensitive to the plight of women.
The prime minister an yearold technocrat who speaks in a low monotone has struggled to channel the popular outrage in his public statements and convince critics that his eightyearold government will take steps to improve the safety of women.
The Congress managers were hamhanded in their handling of the situation that arose after the brutal assault on the girl. The crowd management was poor a lawmaker from Singhs ruling Congress party said on condition of anonymity.
Commentators and sociologists say the rape has tapped into a deep well of frustration many Indians feel over what they see as weak governance and poor leadership on social issues.
A global poll by the Thomson Reuters Foundation in June found that India was the worst place to be a woman because of high rates of infanticide child marriage and slavery.
New Delhi has the highest number of sex crimes among Indias major cities with a rape reported on average every hours according to police figures. Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly percent between and .

A majority of women believe some rape victims should take responsibility for what happened a survey suggests.
Almost three quarters of the women who believed this said if a victim got into bed with the assailant before an attack they should accept some responsibility. 
Onethird blamed victims who had dressed provocatively or gone back to the attackers house for a drink. 
The survey of more than people in London marked the th anniversary of the Haven service for rape victims. 
More than half of those of both sexes questioned said there were some circumstances when a rape victim should accept responsibility for an attack. 
Of the women who believed some victims should take responsibility thought a person should accept responsibility when getting into bed with someone compared with of men. 
Elizabeth Harrison from Haven said there was never an excuse for forcing a woman to do something she did not want to. 
Clearly women are in a position where they need to take responsibility for themselves but whatever you wear and whatever you do does not give somebody else the right to rape you. 
Its important people take the time to actually look at what they are doing and make sure the person they are with is actually wanting to go ahead with what they are proposing. 
The survey also found more than one in people were unsure whether they would report being raped to the police and said they would definitely not do so. 
The main reasons were being too embarrassed or ashamed wanting to forget it had happened and not wanting to go to court . 
Meanwhile the survey suggested that many people are relaxed about their safety. Almost half of people have walked home via side streets on their own. 
One in five has been so drunk they have lost their memory while one in five has got into a taxi without checking whether it is licensed. 
When asked about their own experiences more than a third of those polled said they had been in a situation where they could have been made to have sex against their will. 
And one in five adults had been in a situation where they were made to have sex when they did not want to. This had happened to more women than men .
The online survey titled Wake Up To Rape polled people aged to comprising women and men. 
An Amnesty International report five years ago found that a significant minority of British people laid the blame for rape at victims themselves. 
BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says this latest study suggests attitudes may have hardened. And the findings may help explain why juries are reluctant to convict in some rape trials. 
Amnesty Internationals UK director Kate Allen said the new findings were alarming but sadly not surprising. 
It is depressing that nearly half a decade later people are still quick to blame the victim of rape rather than placing the responsibility where it actually belongs squarely on the shoulders of the perpetrator she said. 
The government has announced that it will develop an integrated strategy to tackle violence against women and these findings are another reminder of how urgent this is and how proper training support and resourcing will be vital in making it a reality. 
The Home Office said it had introduced a number of measures to the service provided to rape victims including new police and prosecutors guidance monitoring of services and funding for support for rape victims.

NEW DELHI The body of a woman whose gang rape provoked protests and rare national debate about violence against women in India arrived back in New Delhi on Sunday and was cremated at a private ceremony.
Scuffles broke out in central Delhi between police and protesters who say the government is doing too little to protect women. But the strong rally was confined to a single area unlike last week when protests raged up throughout the capital.
Riot police manned barricades along streets leading to India Gate war memorial a focal point for demonstrators and at another gathering point the centuriesold Jantar Mantar protesters held banners reading We want justice and Capital punishment.
Most sex crimes in India go unreported many offenders go unpunished and the wheels of justice turn slowly according to social activists who say that successive governments have done little to ensure the safety of women.
The unidentified yearold victim of the December gang rape died of her injuries on Saturday prompting promises of action from a government that has struggled to respond to public outrage.
The medical student had suffered brain injuries and massive internal injuries in the attack and died in hospital in Singapore where she had been taken for treatment.
She and a male friend had been returning home from the cinema media reports say when six men on a bus beat them with metal rods and repeatedly raped the woman. The friend survived.
New Delhi has the highest number of sex crimes among Indias major cities with a rape reported on average every hours police figures show. Reported rape cases rose by nearly percent between and according to government data.
Six suspects were charged with murder after her death and face the death penalty if convicted.
In Kolkata one of Indias four biggest cities police said a man reported that his mother had been gangraped and killed by a group of six men in a small town near the city on Saturday.
She was killed on her way home with her husband a senior official said and the attackers had thrown acid at the husband raped and killed her and dumped her body in a roadside pond.
Police declined to give any further details. One officer told Reuters no criminal investigation had yet been launched.
The leader of Indias ruling Congress party Sonia Gandhi was seen arriving at the airport when the plane carrying the womans body from Singapore landed and Prime Minister Mannmohan Singhs convoy was also there.
A Reuters correspondent saw family members who had been with her in Singapore take her body from the airport to their Delhi home in an ambulance with a police escort.
Her body was then taken to a crematorium and cremated. Media were kept away but a Reuters witness saw the womans family New Delhis chief minister Sheila Dikshit and the junior home minister R P N Singh coming out of the crematorium.
The outcry over the attack caught the government off guard. It took a week for the prime minister to make a statement infuriating many protesters. Last weekend they fought pitched battles with police.
Issues such as rape dowryrelated deaths and female infanticide rarely enter mainstream political discourse.
Analysts say the death of the woman dubbed Amanat an Urdu word meaning treasure by some Indian media could change that though it is too early to say whether the protesters can sustain their momentum through to national elections due in .
U.N. Secretary General Ban KiMoon added his voice to those demanding change calling for further steps and reforms to deter such crimes and bring perpetrators to justice.
Commentators and sociologists say the incident earlier this month has tapped into a deep well of frustration many Indians feel over what they see as weak governance and poor leadership on social issues.
Newspapers raised doubts about the commitment of both male politicians and the police to protecting women.
Would the Indian political system and class have been so indifferent to the problem of sexual violence if half or even onethird of all legislators were women the Hindu newspaper asked.
The Indian Express said it was more complicated than realizing that the police force was understaffed and underpaid.
It is geared towards dominating citizens rather than working for them not to mention being open to influential interests the newspaper said. It reflects the misogyny around us rather than actively fighting for the rights of citizens who happen to be female.

The alleged victim of a rape at an elite New England prep school took the stand on Tuesday breaking down in tears as she identified the former student she says attacked her in a campus building in May . 
The yearold girl struggled to keep her composure as she described how the encounter at St. Pauls School in Concord New Hampshire began with a surprise email invitation from senior Owen Labrie. She took the date request to be part of a campus tradition called senior salute in which older boys pursued younger students in the days before graduation. 
The girl a freshman at the time declined. I wanted to put an end to it there because I thought his intentions were really really wrong she testified. 
But Labrie dispatched a mutual friend who persuaded her to reconsider she said. 
I was thinking Okay heres a person who has paid special attention to me how nice the girl recalled under questioning from Deputy Merrimack County Attorney Catherine Ruffle. 
The days proceedings ended there. The girl will return to the stand Wednesday morning to describe what happened next after they ended up in a secluded area at the top of the Lindsay Center for Mathematics and Science. 
She has told police that after making out Labrie forced her to have sex despite her attempts to resist. 
But Labrie has told police he did not have intercourse with her and that their encounter was consensual. 
He will take the stand later in the trial his defense lawyer Jay Carney said in opening statements earlier Tuesday. 
In Ruffles opening statements the prosecutor said the girl met Labrie expecting some physical intimacy but not sex. Shes a yearold girl without sexual experience Ruffle said. She tried to say no. 
The senior salute is expected to play a significant role in the trial with prosecutors arguing that it was the basis for Labries alleged luring of the girl and defense lawyers saying it helped to show she was a willing participant. 
Theres no question that the accuser knew exactly what Owen was doing by inviting her to get together Carney told the jury on Tuesday. Because it was a source of pride for girls at the school to be asked to participate in the senior salute. 
Prosecutors are expected to call current and former students to testify about the sexual environment at the school. 
Labrie a housing dorm prefect who said he planned to become a minister is charged with three counts of aggravated felony sex assault four counts of misdemeanor sex assault endangering the welfare of a child and using a computer to lure her to meet him via email and Facebook. He has told police that he never had sexual intercourse with her after putting on a condom he experienced a moment of divine inspiration and stopped himself from going any farther. 
The aspiring Harvard divinity student sat quietly at his lawyers courtroom table wearing glasses a sport coat slacks and a slightly unkempt haircut. 
This is the face of Owen Labrie youre going to see in the next few days probably not the face of an individual you think of when you think of a sexual assault Ruffle said. But when you hear the evidence that the state is going to present we believe youre going to see a different side of the defendant. 
Emails and Facebook messages along with testimony from Labries friends will show that he planned the meeting with his accuser for months Ruffle said. She portrayed Labrie as a player in a senior saluteinspired competition in which seniors kept track of liaisons with younger girls conquests they referred to as slaying. The accuser was on Labries list of targets Ruffle said. 
The prosecutor acknowledged that the girl took a few days to go to her family or authorities. Officials collected some physical evidence an abrasion elements of DNA on her underwear but that alone doesnt prove the rape charge Ruffle said. 
Ultimately this comes down to one thing she said at the conclusion of her statement. Do you believe the girl 
Her courtroom testimony about the encounter he predicted would differ from her view of it in the emails and Facebook messages with Labrie. 
Whats more important than what she says today and tomorrow in this court regarding whether she was a willing participant that night was her words that night Carney said. And thank goodness the communication between Owen and the accuser right after they got together are all in writing. 
The messages shared by Carney showed that the girl asked that the encounter be kept secret. They discussed whether he used a condom and whether she was on birth control but there is no accusation of forced sex. 
Ruffle on the other hand had a different interpretation of the electronic communication. 
After the opening statements the jury was taken to the St. Pauls School campus including the scene of the alleged rape. 
Proving yet again that shes not one to bow down to the unwritten diktats of Bollywood Kangana Ranaut at an event held Wednesday evening in Mumbai.
Much has been written and said about the Stanford sexual assault case in which the attacker got off with a light sentence. What stood out in this whole incident however was the grit of the girl. The fact that she decided to let her ordeal be known to the public via a powerful letter. That she had the support of her family and society in doing so.
The Nirbhaya case was a pivotal moment in the continuing evolution of Indian society. The only positive thing that has come out of this tragedy is that sexual violence which is actually a global issue took centre stage in Indian public discourse.
What golden bird The one that is all grey with her feathers mercilessly pulled out leaving behind trails upon trails of dried blood covered by sands of time Or the one we attempt to keep polished for the rest of the world to see The wings of that bird hide within their folds screams and wails and an everincreasing scroll of statistics.

Delhi has long been considered one of the most unsafe big cities for women in India. And north India is often referred to as more violent more patriarchal and more crimeridden than the south.
To add some perspective to this debate here is a look at statistics on reported rapes around the country.
These data carry the caveat that there may be higher reporting rates in different areas and reporting is not necessarily indicative of the prevalence of the crime. Victims may be reluctant to report rape because of fears their case will not be taken seriously and police may be reluctant to register complaints.
In a total of rape cases were registered in India according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau.
The reported number in the south Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Tamil Nadu Kerala and Puducherry was cases.
There were . rapes reported per in in Uttar Pradesh which has a population of . million. In Andhra Pradesh the equivalent figure was . per its population is . million.
The north and south together account for cases approximately of the reported rapes.
The eastern northeastern western and central states account for the remainder.
In the northeast Arunachal Pradesh Assam Manipur Meghalaya Mizoram Nagaland Sikkim and Tripura cases were reported in .
In eastern India Bihar Odisha and West Bengal there were rapes reported more than in all of southern India.
The central and western states of Jharkhand Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh Maharashtra Gujarat and Goa as well as the regions of Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman Diu accounted for cases.
According to the NCRB in Murshidabad a district in West Bengal recorded the highest number of reported rapes for a single district cases and of molestation cases .
Chhattisgarhs Durg Bhilainagarreported the highest rate of reported rape per residents at . more than double Delhis ratio of . per .
Some experts say northern India is perhaps worse than elsewhere in that women may have a harder time in registering complaints effectively.
Vrinda Grover a lawyer in the Supreme Court says that in northern India women are not comfortable going up to the police and filing a complaint or in a similar situation the police dont lodge a complaint.
That has been borne out by the recent news of an yearold girl in the northern state of Punjab who complained to police in November that she was gang raped by three men but committed suicide last week because of alleged police inaction.
According to a report in Outlook Magazine the police registered her complaint days after the incident took place and asked uncomfortable questions every time she went to followup on her complaint.
One police official in the womans village of Badshahpur has been disciplined said Patialas Superintendent of Crime Jaipal Singh on Wednesday without divulging further details.
Since the gangrape and death of a yearold physiotherapy student in Delhi last month further incidents of rape have been reported prominently in Indias newspapers.
The Times of India reported two in Wednesdays edition both in Uttar Pradesh. The Asian Age reported an attempt by five men in Delhi to kidnap and rape a yearold woman.
However activists play down the notion that one area of the country is inherently safer for women than others.
Im afraid we do not have enlightened zones anywhere in the country said Ms. Grover.

Thecabbie who allegedly raped a yearold woman in New Delhi on Friday night has been arrested in Mathura even as questions were raised over security measures provided by Uber the USbased cab firm which used his taxi service.
Shiv Kumar Yadav the yearold driver and a native of Mathura who was living in rented premises in New Delhi has been arrested according to DIG Agra Range Lakshmi Singh.
Singh said the cab in which the crime took place was owned by him and he was traced through his mobile number and has been handed over to the Delhi police. The car was recovered from the city late Saturday night.
As the massive search operation was on in Mathura and other parts of Uttar Pradesh to nab the accused Delhi Police had earlier in the day announced a cash reward of Rs one lakh for his arrest.
The police have also issued a notice to Uber the USbased cab service provider under section CrPC to join investigation in the case.
We have issued them a notice to join investigation. There are norms to operate such cab service set by the Transport Department and we will see whether they were followed or not said Deputy Commissioner of Police North Madhur Verma.
The shocking incident which took place days ahead of the second anniversary of the December gangrape brought back memories of the horrific crime as shock and anger erupted both online and offline.
According to the police neither the driver was verified nor the cab had a GPS tracker.
The company has issued a statement saying that it was providing all help to the police in the investigation.
Our thoughts are with the victim of this terrible crime and we are working with the police as they investigate. We will assist them in any way we can. It is also our policy to immediately suspend a drivers account following allegations of a serious incident which we have done.
Safety is Ubers highest priority and in India we work with licenced driverpartners to provide a safe transportation option with layers of safeguards such as driver and vehicle information and ETAsharing to ensure there is accountability and traceability of all trips that occur on the Uber platform said Evelyn Tay an Uber spokeswoman.
The driver did not have a driving licence issued by the Delhi Transport Authority and the only link the service provider had with him was an Smartphone App which he exited after the incident the police said.
On the way the woman dozed off on the back seat of the car only to wake up and find that they had stopped at a secluded spot. She found that the car doors were locked and when she tried to raise an alarm the driver thrashed her and then committed rape the police said.
The accused then dropped her off near her home in Inderlok after threatening to kill her if she spoke of the matter to anybody.

In I witnessed a gang rape in Sierra Leone. I was forced to watch a group of rebel soldiers taking it in turns to rape a young girl in front of an audience of jeering men. It was the height of the civil conflict and rape had become a devastating weapon of war. When I moved to Britain I believed I had escaped such horrific sexual violence. As my Dispatches investigation tomorrow night shows I was mistaken. Gang rape is happening here and what I have found most disturbing as an African is that a disproportionate number of these attacks are being carried out by black or mixedrace young men.
Towards the end of last year police and child welfare experts working on Channel s Street Weapons Commission told us of their concerns about gang rape. Then two big cases hit the headlines.
In December nine schoolboys some as young as at the time of the attack were convicted of raping a yearold girl. She was dragged between tower blocks in Hackney where she was threatened with a knife hit and raped during an ordeal that lasted an hour and a half some of which was filmed on mobile phones. In January three men were convicted of gang raping a yearold with learning disabilities for two hours before dousing her with caustic soda in an effort to get rid of the evidence.
We approached the Crown Prosecution Service the Association of Chief Police Officers all police forces crown courts barristers and rape referral centres to try to establish the numbers.
One of the few police forces to have begun recording the figures of reported gang rape is the Metropolitan Police. In alone they received reports of gang rapes. Using the Mets definition of gang rape those involving three or more perpetrators we began to look at the number of convictions. We tracked down cases from January to March in which a total of young people were convicted of involvement in gang rape.
One fact stood out. Of those convicted were black or mixed race were white and the remainder were from other countries including Afghanistan Iraq and Libya.
Clearly this is not a crime exclusive to black communities but I found it impossible to ignore the fact that such a high proportion were committed by black and mixedrace young men. As a black man as well as a journalist I wanted to understand what lay behind such attacks. So I spoke to victims groups of black and mixedrace teenagers youth and social workers and community leaders.
The groups of young men I met in London expressed some profoundly disturbing attitudes towards girls and sex. The boys explained how they make arrangements for lineups in which one girl has oral sex with up to six or seven of them at one time. These arrangements might be made at school or on mobile phones.
In other instances as some of the victims in our film describe girls can unwittingly walk into a trap innocently visiting someones house to listen to music or watch a film only to discover that a group of boys are lying in wait. Or they might be hanging out with friends in a park and suddenly realise they have become surrounded by a group of boys intent on sex.
For both boys and girls the line between this sort of group sex and rape seems to be blurred. A girl might agree to have oral sex with two or three boys but then be ordered to have sex with six or seven. The teenage girls I met told me that boys simply dont understand what rape is. And yet this is a crime that can ruin lives and is punishable by life imprisonment.
Occasionally gang rape is used to punish a girl for minor transgressions against gang members. In one of my most shocking interviews I met a girl who admitted she had helped to set up girls for gang rape. As the girlfriend of a gang member she organised these rapes partly out of fear and partly to fit in.
The victims descriptions of their attacks are horrific. One young victim likened her attack to being pulled and pushed around like a rag doll while another yearold girl described her ordeal when she was gang raped by a total of nine boys who told her that she was not the only girl they had attacked. In that case nine boys were subsequently convicted of raping her. The youngest perpetrator was just years old.
Gang rape while constituting only a tiny percentage of all rapes in the UK is a horrible reality in this country. The nature of the crime is so appalling that much more research needs to be carried out into its causes. But what seems evident from my investigation is that the key to preventing it will be changing the way young men view women and the kind of group sexual activity they are engaging in at such a young age.

Detectives are investigating possible links between the assault and a series of sexual attacks against men in the capital in recent months.
In the latest incident a year old man was raped on Hampstead Heath in north London on Tuesday after being forced off a Northern Line train. Police appealed for witnesses to the abduction which took place at .pm.
The attack followed six previous assaults on men in London during the summer months. One took place on an Underground train in another a man was raped after being abducted outside Leicester Square station. In August a man was raped in lavatories at another central London tube station.
In the latest case the victim was travelling in an empty front carriage to Golders Green where he had arranged to meet his girlfriend at a night school.
The three men armed with a handgun and a knife walked in through a connecting door while the train was between stations. They forced him on to another train to Hampstead where he was taken to the heath and assaulted by all three.
Police believe the area was busy at the time of the attack which lasted five minutes. They said the victim was in shock.
The string of attacks in London has begun to focus public attention on the subject of male rape sometimes termed the last taboo. While attitudes to female rape have been transformed over the past years there is a reluctance to acknowledge a phenomenon that challenges mens fundamental notions about their masculinity and invulnerability.
Male rape does not exist as a criminal offence under British law the assaults are recorded as nonconsensual buggery. The Metropolitan Police investigated such offences against adult males in the year ending last April but welfare organisations believe that as many as nine in incidents are not reported.
Survivors a national counselling organisation for male rape victims received calls last year. Henry Leak chairman of the organisation believes that they represent the tip of the iceberg.
Mr Leak said that reluctance to report attacks stemmed from feelings of shame and humiliation. There is the fear that he will not be believed or that people will think that he asked for it that he must be gay or weak unable to defend himself.
He also pointed to differences in the law convicted rapists can be imprisoned for life whereas buggery carries a maximum sentence of years. The perception by some people of police officers as homophobic also plays a part.
However the growing seriousness with which this offence is treated is reflected in the Metropolitan Polices piloting of a victim support unit.
According to Mr Leak male rape is not confined to the homosexual community and like female rape it has more to do with power than sexuality. The effects he said can be devastating and long term with feelings of frustration powerlessness and anger experienced by victims.

Indian police arrest one man and are seeking four more suspects after two teenage girls were allegedly gang raped and hanged in Uttar Pradesh state.
Police in India have arrested four men including at least two police officers for allegedly raping and killing two teenage girls. The girls bodies were discovered hanging from a mango tree.
The incident took place in the village of Katra in Indias northwestern state of Uttar Pradesh.
The girls who were and and are either sisters or cousins it was not immediately clear had gone into fields near where they lived because there was no toilet in their home said Atul Saxena police superintendent for the area.
Indian TV footage showed the villagers sitting under the girls bodies as they swung in the wind and preventing authorities from taking them down from the tree until the suspects were arrested.
The victims families maintain that local police initially shielded the attackers according to multiple local media reports although that claim has not been independently verified.
Autopsies confirmed the girls had been gangraped and strangled before being hanged Saxena said.
He said that an investigation was still taking place into the specific circumstances of the case and that police are seeking others who may have been involved.
The Asian Center for Human Rights published a report last year revealing that child rape cases were recorded in India from to . The annual number of reported cases rose over that period.
More broadly records show a rape is committed every minutes in India a nation of . billion people.
Last year India tightened its rape laws making gang rape punishable by the death penalty even if the victim survives the attack.
That move came after the fatal gang rape of a yearold woman on a moving bus in New Delhi that triggered nationwide protests and made headlines around the world.

Why isnt it a crime for a man to rape his wife in India The government says its because of poverty religious beliefs social customs and the mindset of the Indian society among other things.
A federal minister said Wednesday that Indias Bharatiya Janata Partyled government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not plan to introduce punishments for marital rape.
It is considered that the concept of marital rape as understood internationally cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary said in a written statement to Indias upper house of Parliament.
He attributed this to various factors e.g. level of educationilliteracy poverty myriad social customs and values religious beliefs mindset of the society to treat the marriage as a sacrament etc.
Mr. Chaudhury a minister in Indias Ministry of Home Affairs was replying to a member of Parliament who had sought the governments stance on marital rape.
Whether or not to criminalize rape within marriage has long been debated in India. The United Nations has recommended India make it criminal for a man to rape his wife. Criminalizing marital rape was also one of the suggestions of the Verma Committee a threemember panel appointed to strengthen Indias sexualassault laws in the wake of a brutal gang rape in .
The government then led by the Congress party had rejected this proposal. A panel of lawmakers who opposed the move at the time argued it had the potential of destroying the institution of marriage.
If marital rape is brought under the law the entire family system will be under great stress a report submitted by lawmakers to Parliament had said in . The government eventually passed a new sexualassault law which did not criminalize marital rape.
Lawyers and womens rights activists have criticized the decision to leave marital rape out of the penal code.
Many countries have made it a crime for a husband to force his wife to have sex in recent years. Malaysia changed its laws to that effect in Turkey in and Bolivia in . The United States began criminalizing marital rape in s and most European countries in the s.
China Afghanistan Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are some of the countries that do not criminalize marital rape.

Doctorshave announced thata young Indian woman who was gangraped and severely beaten on a bus in Indias capital New Delhihas died attheir Singapore hospital.
A statement by Singapores Mount Elizabeth Hospital where the yearold victim was being treated said she died peacefully early on Saturday.
We are very sad to report that the patient passed away peacefully at .am local time on December Kelvin Loh the chief executive of Mount Elizabeth Hospital said in a statement.
Despite all efforts by a team of eight specialists in Mount Elizabeth Hospital to keep her stable her condition continued to deteriorate over these two days Loh continued.
The statement said her family and officials from the High Commission of India were by her side.
As this developed Al Jazeeras Divya Gopalan is reporting that Indias police will be filing murder charges against the gangrape suspects.
Back in Singapore the hospital saidthe woman a paramedic studenthad remained in an extremely critical condition since Thursday when she was flown to Singapore from India.
By late Friday her condition had taken a turn for the worse and her vital signs had indicated severe organ failure the hospital had earlier said.
She hadalso suffered a heart attack a lung and abdominal infection and significant brain injury it said.
After news of her death Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was deeply saddened and pledged to channel emotions surrounding the case into concrete action.
The case had generated emotions and energies among young Indians seeking changes in society he said in a statement.
It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channel these emotions and energies into a constructive course of action.
The family of course is shattered by this development. At the same time they realise that the best possible medical attention was provided to her. At the end it was the scale of her injuries which proved too much for the medical treatment that was provided to her.
Raghavan said the family had expressed a desire for her body to be flown back to India.
The deceased and her family members will be flown back to India in a chartered aircraft later this afternoon he said on Saturday.
The horrific ordeal of the woman galvanised Indians who have held almost daily demonstrations to demand greater protection from sexual violence from groping to rape that impacts thousands of women every day but which often goes unreported.
The victim and a male friend were traveling in a public bus on December night when they were attacked by six men who raped her and beat them both.
They also inserted the rod in her body stripped both naked and threw them off the bus on a road. Police have arrestedthe six attackers.
The attack two weeks ago brought new focus on police and community attitudes toward woman in India. Demonstrators in New Delhi have demanded stronger protections for women and stronger punishment for rapists.
The government has ordered an official inquiry into the attack and promised new laws to protect women as well as stiffer penalties forsex crimes.
Italso announced plans to post the photos names and addresses of convicted rapists on official websites to publicly shame them. The campaign is scheduled to begin in Delhi which has been dubbed Indias rape capital.

Missouri Congressman Todd Akin a conservative Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate said in an interview broadcast Sunday that womens bodies can prevent pregnancies in the case of a legitimate rape adding that conception in such cases is rare.
Rep. Todd Akin who has said he opposes all abortions said in the interview if a woman is raped her body has ways to shut that whole thing down.
Rep. Todd Akin who has said he opposes all abortions said in the interview if a woman is raped her body has ways to shut that whole thing down.
Akin a sixterm congressman running against incumbent Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill was asked in an interview on St. Louis television station KTVI if he would support abortions for women who have been raped.
It seems to me first of all from what I understand from doctors thats really rare Akin said. If its a legitimate rape the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down Akin said of a rape victims chances of becoming pregnant.
Akin said in an emailed statement later Sunday that he misspoke during the interview though the statement did not specify which points or comments.
In reviewing my offthecuff remarks its clear that I misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy I hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year Akins statement said.
Akin also said in the statement he believes deeply in the protection of all life and I do not believe that harming another innocent victim is the right course of action.
Akins comments also brought a swift rebuke from the campaign of presumptive Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
Governor Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan disagree with Mr. Akins statement and a RomneyRyan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg said.
McCaskill who is seeking a second term said Sunday in an emailed statement that she found the comments offensive.
It is beyond comprehension that someone can be so ignorant about the emotional and physical trauma brought on by rape McCaskill said. The ideas that Todd Akin has expressed about the serious crime of rape and the impact on its victims are offensive.
This month Akin won the states Republican U.S. Senate primary by a comfortable margin. During the primary Akin enhanced his standing with TV ads in which former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee praised him as a courageous conservative and a Biblebased Christian who supports traditional marriage and defends the unborn.
Akin a former state lawmaker who first won election to the U.S. House in also has a longestablished base among evangelical Christians and was endorsed in the primary by more than pastors.
Terry ONeill president of the National Organization for Women on Sunday called Akins remarks flatout astonishing.
That kind of rhetoric retraumatizes sexual assault victims. That kind of talk I believe is intended to shame women she told AP Radio.
Akin was interviewed on KTVIs The Jaco Report and also talked about numerous campaign issues such as voter ID laws the economy and Medicare. KTVI said the interview was conducted earlier in the week.

Four former students of William Paterson University who were accused of raping a student on campus last year have filed a lawsuit against the school alleging that they were falsely arrested maliciously prosecuted and subjected to civilrights violations that left them with ruined educational futures and permanently tarnished reputations.
The students who were arrested and charged with aggravated sexual assault and numerous other offenses were suspended from the school in November . University President Kathleen Waldron at the time issued a statement in which she sympathized with the accuser and said she was angry and dismayed that this crime was committed on our campus and allegedly by students.
Neither Waldron nor Marybeth Zeman a spokeswoman for the university could be reached for comment Tuesday.
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in state Superior Court in Paterson an attorney for Collick and Williams said the accuser initiated consensual sex with the five defendants on Nov. at the Overlook South dorm building. All of them were on good terms afterward but the accuser went to the campus police later that day and reported the incident as a sexual assault said Michael Epstein the attorney.
Without conducting any investigation and based on the accusers report alone campus police arrested the men within the next few days and charged them with numerous offenses including aggravated sexual assault kidnapping conspiracy to commit sexual assault and criminal restraint.
Campus police did not interview any other witnesses did not obtain cellphone records or surveillance video and did not conduct a sexual assault examination known as a rape kit on the accuser Epstein said.
The officers who did the reported investigation were untrained did not know how to conduct a sexual assault investigation Epstein said Tuesday.
Had they conducted a proper investigation they would have found out that the accuser had called Collick times that day with hopes of luring him into intercourse Epstein said in the lawsuit.
Interviews with other students would have revealed that the accuser was very sexually active at William Paterson had many sexual partners engaged in sexual activities with more than one partner on multiple occasions had to change dormitory rooms because her roommate was uncomfortable with the level of the accusers sexual activity Epstein said in the lawsuit. Epstein also said the accuser had previous relations with Collick and Williams.
Ron Ricci an attorney representing Singleton and Latimer said he has filed a similar lawsuit in Superior Court in Jersey City against Waldron and the accuser. He said he will file an amended complaint within the next few weeks to include the campus police officers who were involved in the investigation.
That lawsuit accuses Waldron of defamation and libel and includes allegations of false arrest false imprisonment and violation of civil rights Ricci said.
Epstein said in his lawsuit that Collick and Williams who were both at the time were extremely scared when they spent nine days at the Passaic County Jail after their arrest and that they slept in shifts to protect each other. Their families were forced to spend money to post their bails which were set at each he said.
Despite lack of evidence to pursue the criminal charges both were expelled from the school for allegedly violating a student code of conduct Epstein said. Collick and Williams secured admission to the school through a special loan for students from disadvantaged backgrounds he said. Reenrolling will be difficult for them because those funds will not be available again Epstein said.
Because of the highly publicized arrest Collick and Williams suffered irreparable damage to their reputations and their names and photographs will forever be synonymously linked to rape sexual assault and kidnapping Epstein said in the lawsuit.
He said Collick is now working as a busboy and that he was not aware of the status of Williams.
Williams mother Nancy Williams is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. The defendants include the university Waldron the campus police department University Police Detective Sgt. Ellen DeSimone and Robert Fulleman director of Public Safety and University Police.
Collick Williams Singleton and Latimer are seeking unspecified amounts in compensatory and punitive damages. Scott has not filed suit in the case.

The Burmese army has used rape and sexual violence against women for decades as part of their warfare against ethnic minority groups in the country. This has been done with impunity and denial. Cases of women and girls being raped by soldiers from the governments forces include the rape of a year old girl in front of her mother and of a disabled woman. Many of the victims were gangraped and many killed afterwards. This is in breach of international law and constitutes a war crime. Reports of rape have increased in recent years.

A prolife rally in Ottawa Thursday that drew thousands of people to Parliament Hill got walltowall coverage from Sun News Network but some of the prochoice activists who staged a counterdemonstration say the conservative news channels Faith Goldy crossed the line with her aggressive questioning.
Ottawabased social justice activist Julie Lalonde said Goldy and a cameraman approached her and other prochoice demonstrators and began peppering them with questions without introducing themselves or asking what brought them to the annual March for Life event.
She filmed me extensively even when I asked her to back away and leave us alone. She actually did a close up on me when I told her to leave us alone and said Or else If I dont walk away what are you going to do
She was clearly trolling and trying to provoke us to build some outrageous footage.
At one point Lalonde says Goldy asked another demonstrator about a coathanger she was carrying to symbolize the drastic measures some women take to terminate pregnancies and that legal access to abortions is safer than prohibition.
Thats when Faith launched into So we should legalize rape then Are you saying we should legalize rape Is that what youre saying Legalize rape and murder And kept aggressively questioning us said Lalonde.
When the segment aired on Sun News later that day those questions comparing abortions to rape didnt make the cut and Lalonde was only briefly featured.
SUN TV said if abortion is legalized to make it safe then should rape be legalized to make it safe They will surely edit our responses.
Goldy who thinks the Pope should excommunicate Justin Trudeau over his prochoice views insisted it isnt just religious nutbags who attend such rallies.
Goldy has so far been unwilling to formulate a response to questions from Canada.com and has not addressed the allegations on her Twitter or Facebook profiles.
Sun News has previously gotten in trouble with its aggressive interviews most notably when a host hectored ballet dancer Margie Gillis over government arts funding a performance that led to thousands of complaints to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council. The CBSC ultimately concluded host Krista Erickson had not crossed any ethical boundaries in the interview.
Doctorshave announced thata young Indian woman who was gangraped and severely beaten on a bus in Indias capital New Delhihas died attheir Singapore hospital.
A statement by Singapores Mount Elizabeth Hospital where the yearold victim was being treated said she died peacefully early on Saturday.
We are very sad to report that the patient passed away peacefully at .am local time on December Kelvin Loh the chief executive of Mount Elizabeth Hospital said in a statement.
Despite all efforts by a team of eight specialists in Mount Elizabeth Hospital to keep her stable her condition continued to deteriorate over these two days Loh continued.
The statement said her family and officials from the High Commission of India were by her side.
As this developed Al Jazeeras Divya Gopalan is reporting that Indias police will be filing murder charges against the gangrape suspects.
Back in Singapore the hospital saidthe woman a paramedic studenthad remained in an extremely critical condition since Thursday when she was flown to Singapore from India.
By late Friday her condition had taken a turn for the worse and her vital signs had indicated severe organ failure the hospital had earlier said.
She hadalso suffered a heart attack a lung and abdominal infection and significant brain injury it said.
After news of her death Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was deeply saddened and pledged to channel emotions surrounding the case into concrete action.
The case had generated emotions and energies among young Indians seeking changes in society he said in a statement.
It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channel these emotions and energies into a constructive course of action.
The family of course is shattered by this development. At the same time they realise that the best possible medical attention was provided to her. At the end it was the scale of her injuries which proved too much for the medical treatment that was provided to her.
Raghavan said the family had expressed a desire for her body to be flown back to India.
The deceased and her family members will be flown back to India in a chartered aircraft later this afternoon he said on Saturday.
The horrific ordeal of the woman galvanised Indians who have held almost daily demonstrations to demand greater protection from sexual violence from groping to rape that impacts thousands of women every day but which often goes unreported.
The victim and a male friend were traveling in a public bus on December night when they were attacked by six men who raped her and beat them both.
They also inserted the rod in her body stripped both naked and threw them off the bus on a road. Police have arrestedthe six attackers.
The attack two weeks ago brought new focus on police and community attitudes toward woman in India. Demonstrators in New Delhi have demanded stronger protections for women and stronger punishment for rapists.
The government has ordered an official inquiry into the attack and promised new laws to protect women as well as stiffer penalties forsex crimes.
Italso announced plans to post the photos names and addresses of convicted rapists on official websites to publicly shame them. The campaign is scheduled to begin in Delhi which has been dubbed Indias rape capital.

The alleged attack occurred inside Kosciuszko Park at approximately p.m. Police say the women ages and were sitting in the park when they were approached by a group of juveniles they described as black males.
One of the women called to report a rape but it was unclear if there were other witnesses to assist in the investigation. Detectives at this point do not have any suspects.
Take accountability step up turn yourselves in so that way we could move forward Cpl. Jamaine Crawford of Wilmington Police said according to NBCPhiladelphia.com.
Frank Roberts lives across the street from the park said I cant believe it. . Didnt hear a thing. None or us did. We were all home.
The alleged attackers fled in an unknown direction the report said. The condition of the women who were taken by ambulance to Christiana Hospital was not released the report said.
This park is not safe to walk around in at night Louise Riley who lives near the park told Delawareonline.com. You can tell that a lot goes on in here by the discarded condoms and police driving by cannot see the isolated pockets from the road.
Despite the stepped up patrols in the park Roberts isnt taking any chances with his yearold granddaughter.
Im gonna to tell her to stay out of the park after dark or during the day he said.

Thousands of Syrians fled to Jordans Zataari refugee camp to escape violence at home. But now women and children live in fear of kidnap rape and sham marriages in the camp meant to keep them safe.
Please wait while this video loads. If it doesnt load after a few seconds you may need to have Adobe Flash installed.
If agony has a sound it is the cry to God made by yearold Shahira as she sits broken and bereft in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.
In her black hijab she raises her hands to the sky almost unable to make sense of her own distress. Bashar Bashar she keeps crying. Why are you butchering us
Shahira is one of a hundred thousand Syrians whose home is now the sprawling tented city of Zataari. They fled the fighting to seek shelter and safety. But for many women the camp has offered them anything but.
Three girls in our camp were kidnapped explains Israa Mohammed. They raped them. Then they brought them back to the camp. The Jordanian guys they come to harass Syrian girls from the age of seven or six.
They see we dont have money. They want to exploit us. Give me your daughter for lira or lira. Its exploitation. Abu Sanad father
Such reports of women being kidnapped assaulted or raped abound around the camp. Women say security is non existent. They are too afraid even to go to the toilet at night alone.
I come with my daughter she enters and I stand here waiting for her says Um Hammad. There are girls who dont come to the toilet at night. We stay until the morning holding it in.
Um Majed pictured left is a Syrian housewife from Homs. She says she understands the refugee families and women who give into the demands of the men from the Gulf offering desperately needed cash. These are dark days for Syrians she offers up by way of reasoning.
She has chosen her own way to deal with such bleak times. She has become a marriage broker offering Syrian girls for sex.
He comes for a coffee and he sees her with her hijab he pays the dinar and leaves says Um Majed outlining the charges. If he wants to marry her he has to pay or more. He has to sign a marriage agreement and he takes her and even after one hour they can get divorced. Its none of my business. 
Frustrated by the authorities inability to deal with this problem residents of the camp are forming vigilante groups. They patrol the area they say to protect their women. They mete out their own justice on the men they decide are the perpetrators.
It is one of many problems the authorities now face. Young men angry frustrated and bored are running out of control. Several riots have broken out in the camp.
The United Nations says it is working hard with the Jordanian government to set up a proper policing structure and have announced a new security initiative.
But it may never ease the pain of the women refugees. That will only be soothed when they are allowed to go back to their beloved Syria.
Um Majed throws her head back and sighs. I wish to go back to Syria. I wish to breathe the air of my country. Inshallah I will go back.
But it is more in hope than expectation. She recognises what their future might hold.
I hope we dont have the same destiny of the Palestinians who went out of their country and never went back.
The film on the plight of Syrias refugees will be shown on Channel News on Thursday from pm. It was directed produced and filmed by Sharron Ward. The editor was Agnieszka Liggett.
As well as the fear of attack there is another more insidious assault on the women and girls of Zaatari. Men usually from Saudi Arabia and other gulf states are given free rein at the camp. Coming in the guise of benefactors offering charity in return many want a wife.
But these are marriages of convenience for the men at least. So called pleasure marriages they give cover a sheen of respectability to what is often wealthy men exploiting vulnerable women for sex.
What do they see us as A market place for selling Like selling sheep. They see we dont have money. They want to exploit us. Give me your daughter for lira or lira. Its exploitation.
The men often promise the earth. Lama says she was told she would live like a princess. But the reality often means a few days or weeks out of the camp then they are dumped alone in Jordan or left to come back to Zaatari humiliated and abused.

Indians gathered in their thousands in protests and candlelit vigils to mark the death in a Singapore hospital of a woman beaten and gang raped in New Delhi as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh led appeals for calm.
Delhi police will press murder charges against the six men accused of raping the yearold woman and beating her with iron bars in the back of the bus on Dec. spokesman Rajan Bhagat said by phone yesterday. The men may appear in court to be charged as soon as Jan. he said.
Some demonstrators held placards calling for the death penalty for the alleged rapists and improved treatment for women as they congregated in Mumbai Hyderabad and Bangalore. Others braved the cold winters evening in New Delhi to carry candles or meet in quiet prayer. Earlier crowds heckled Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit near parliament in the capital.
The victim attacked in a moving bus passed away peacefully early on Dec. with her family and officials from the High Commission of India at her side according to a statement from Kelvin Loh chief executive officer at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. She had suffered serious injuries to her body and brain he said. An Air India plane carrying her body landed at New Delhi airport early today after a flight from Singapore the Press Trust of India reported.
Police yesterday barricaded roads in New Delhi and closed subway stations to keep control over the swelling crowds and prevent a recurrence of earlier violent demonstrations in the capital. Protests were barred in the capital except at a designated site Bhagat said in televised comments.
We have already seen the emotions and energies this incident has generated Singh said in an emailed statement. It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channel these emotions and energies into a constructive course of action he said. Its up to all Indians to ensure that her death will not have been in vain.
Singh has appointed a retired Delhi High Court judge to investigate the crime and fix lapses in policing. He also pledged to consider tougher penalties for sex crimes after the assault prompted street demonstrations organized through socialmedia postings. The protesters who fought water cannons and tear gas on Dec. and Dec. demanded more be done to protect women in the capital and across India.
The need of the hour is a dispassionate debate and inquiry into the critical changes that are required in societal attitudes Singh said in his statement yesterday.
After tricking the woman and her yearold male friend into boarding the unauthorized chartered bus with dark tinted windows and heavy curtains the crew of the vehicle and accomplices assaulted the two over a period of about minutes stripped them and then threw them out.
The woman a physiotherapy student whose name cant be revealed under Indian laws was flown to Singapore for specialist treatment paid for by the Indian government.
The increased public role of women is accompanied by growing threats to their safety and security the prime minister said on Dec. . We must reflect on this problem which occurs in all states and regions of our country.

Singh has vowed to hasten prosecution of the accused. The panel led by the former chief justice of the Supreme Court has been asked to rewrite criminal codes to allow harsher penalties to be imposed including capital punishment in the rarest of rare rape cases.
It typically takes years for ordinary Indians to get justice because of a slowmoving legal process and overburdened courts. Longrunning trials and lax enforcement of laws have also fueled protests in the nations capital. About cases were pending in the Supreme Court as of July of which percent have been on the roll for more than a year government data show.

As of now the lead pair of Abhi and Pragya is not making eye to eye contact and has even driven far from each other. Unfortunately Abhi might never come to know that Pragya is hiding her true love just to save him from the enemies.
As per rumours the coming episodes will show Pragya landing in huge trouble. She while preparing for the Ganeshotsav festival will be abducted by the goons. Abhi the hero of the show will see the events unfold in front of his eyes and will try to save Pragya to prove that whatever she does to hurt him he will never stop loving her.
Alas Abhis efforts will go in vain. From what we hear the writers of the show are planning to bring a mammoth sized twist in the show. If rumours are to be believed fans dearest Pragya will not only be abducted but raped too.
If you are wondering which evil minds will bring such a misfortune to her life they are none other than Aaliya and Tanu. In fact Raj along with these two antagonists will threaten Bulbul to get away from Purabs life.
Now that Abhis effort to rescue Pragya would go in vain but will he realise that it his closed ones who are backstabbing him Most importantly what will Pragya do to bring her life back to normal

Crystal Mangum who falsely accused Duke lacrosse players of sexual crimes in was convicted of seconddegree murder on Nov. . AP
CNSNews.com When Crystal Mangum falsely accused several Duke lacrosse players of rape in there were major television news stories in the first five days after the players were arrested but in when Mangum was convicted of murder and sentenced to years in prison there were only major television news stories a difference in coverage of .
When the Duke lacrosserape story broke in MarchApril it was huge news garnering massive widespread coverage by the networks ABC CBS and NBC as well as by FOX CNN and MSNBC and the print press such as USA Today New York Times and Washington Post.
Basically the story was that members of the Duke lacrosse team had a party on March at an offcampus house where two strippers had been hired to perform one of them was Crystal Mangum then years old. At some point there were some verbal exchanges between Mangum and some persons at the party. Mangum left with the other stripper and later that eveningearly morning Mangum told police she had been raped.
Former North Carolina District Attorney prosecutor Mike Nifong a Democrat who was disbarred for his conduct in prosecuting the Duke lacrosse players and was later convicted of criminal contempt of court. AP
Although the rape claims by Mangum were totally false she was not charged with a crime.
The lacrosse players Finnerty and Seligmann were arrested on Apr. and charged with rape and kidnapping. In the five days following Apr. a Nexis news search of the terms Duke rape and lacrosse in All English Language News shows there were news stories of which were from major television news outlets and six that were on NPR.
Those major television news outlets included ABCs World News Tonight Nightline Good Morning America the CBS Evening News the Today show NBC Nightly News CNN Live Fox News MSNBCs Scarborough Country and Countdown and myriad other TV news programs.
Last Friday Nov. Crystal Mangum the false Dukerape accuser was convicted by a jury of seconddegree murder she had stabbed her boyfriend and sentenced to years in prison. In the five days since Nov. a Nexis news search of the words Crystal Mangum murder Duke and lacrosse in All English Language News reveals there were total news stories but only major television news reports one on Fox and two on CNN.
The big television networks ABC CBS and NBC and the liberal MSNBC and NPR did not report on Mangums murder conviction.
The television news industry and NPR gave more coverage to the dubious allegations against the three lacrosse players which were proven to be completely false and politically charged than they gave the jurytried murder conviction of Crystal Mangum the false accuser.

The battle over what constitutes sexual assault on college campuses is reaching new levels of absurdity.
She was in her room with a guy with whom shed been hooking up for three months. Theyd now decided mutually she thought just to be friends. When he ended up falling asleep on her bed she changed into pajamas and climbed in next to him. Soon he was putting his arm around her and taking off her clothes. I basically said No I dont want to have sex with you. And then he said Okay thats fine and stopped the woman told me. And then he started again a few minutes later taking off my panties taking off his boxers. I just kind of laid there and didnt do anything I had already said no. I was just tired and wanted to go to bed. I let him finish. I pulled my panties back on and went to sleep.
After one of my colleagues read the page proofs for the piece he came into my office. Did you find that first incident to be a little ambiguous he asked tentatively. I told him I didnt find it ambiguous at all it didnt meet my definition of rape. Another colleague overheard our conversation and joined us. She too said what happened to the woman didnt sound like rapeOr if it is she added Ive been raped in every relationship Ive ever been in.
A few days later that first colleague and I were discussing the piece with another staffer who is in her s. She was adamant that what the woman experienced was rape. But I did worry when I read it the younger staffer admitted that some people wouldnt see it that way.
Three years ago I wrote an article for the magazine called The New Rules of College Sex. In it I discussed a Dear Colleague letter of guidance the Department of Education had recently sent to all colleges in the country laying out how they would be required to treat claims of sexual assault and harassment on their campuses in light of Title IX the federal law prohibiting gender discrimination in education.
Okay so Im all fired up again. In the last two weeks Ive worked on five cases all involving drunken hookups on college campuses. In each case the male accused of sexual misconduct was found responsible. In each case I thought the college got it completely wrong. Some boards and panels still cant tell the difference between drunk sex and a policy violation. Surely every drunken hookup is not a punishable offense. 
Consent to engage in sexual activity must be knowing and voluntary it must exist from the beginning to end of each instance of sexual activity and for each form of sexual contact. 
Consent consists of an outward demonstration indicating that an individual has freely chosen to engage in sexual activity. Relying on nonverbal communication can lead to misunderstandings. Consent may not be inferred from silence passivity lack of resistance or lack of an active response alone. A person who does not physically resist or verbally refuse sexual activity is not necessarily giving consent.
Its understandable that schools want to institute rules to clarify when sexual activity is consensual and when its not on their campuses. The problem comes when you try to extend that rarefied vision to the outside world. When people who havent been treated to the extended hairsplitting of the Swarthmore code of conduct look at the issue of consent it isnt nearly so clear. Ive been married to my husband for years. In that time I cant say my consenting to sex with him has always been verbal or enthusiastic another adjective sexualassault activists like to throw in there. Its unimaginable to me that two young partners in the throes of one of their earliest sexual experiences would stop and clarify verbally the others willingness to continue before continuing such activity. Maybe if thats the way youve been taught you do. But what makes a person guilty of sexual assault on a college campus rarely arises to what would amount to guilt in a court of law. And having two separate jurisdictions and two separate definitions of rape really gums up the works.
The women filing Title IX claims against their colleges say the administrators have ignored or brushed aside their complaints of sexual assault. Theres an instance in Simons piece where a woman
says a male student burst into her room while she was naked and refused to leave after having harassed her via text message. According to her Title IX complaint when she reported the incident an administrator laughed and told her she might consider having him write knock on his hand as a reminder before he goes out.
You can read that as an example of an administrator being incredibly insensitive to a sexual assault. Or you can see it as a student overreacting to a minor trespass with crossed signals between her and the administrator.

Are you honestly trying to argue that its an overreaction for someone to report a student who broke into her room to try to watch her have sex Is this real life
That wasnt the story listed. It was that a male student came in while she was nude and refused to leave.
If the definition is true then I have been raped countless number of times by women I was just not aware of it then. More ridiculousness women are having less choices than ever and feminists must be prosecuted for several decades of hate crimes.
I dont think we should be tying up the courts with petty buyers remorse otherwise half of our nation would be on trial for rape. Get some perspective.
The idea that someone should persist because of the possibility that the other person will give in ignores basic human decency. No one should disregard the wishes of another person especially when it comes to something as intimate as sex. It sure as heck doesnt foster a relationship built on trust.
Im uncomfortable with the repetition of rape is a horrible crime when it comes from the keyboards of sexists and misogynists. The implication is that only the most violent forceful assaults are really rape and that everything else is not.
The crucial issue that is steadfastly ignored is lack of consent. Its based on the assumption that the wishes and feelings of the victim are unimportant and I reject it on that basis.
Except of course when the victims are boys and men and then suddenly their feelings matter to sexists and misogynists. Consistency and less hypocrisy would be appreciated.
Just because you are uncomfortable it does not change the fact I have been raped too as per the definition. the fact is it was not forced rape is attributed to forced you are minimizing the pain of an actual rape victims by comparing something heinous with a childish behavior of some WOMYN. An idiot like you do not understand if you pollute the definition eventually it will go both ways. Be careful what you ask for because you might get it but can you live with it
I thought you were a sensible person when you first interacted then I found out that you were biased and I tried to reason with you but now I realize you are in fact a very mean and evl person who LOL on every male sufferings. I just can not get it. I remember you were obsessed with women doing genocide as if story of male suffering gives you pleasure.
Im LOLing at ridiculous claims. In this case it was that feminists should be prosecuted for hate crimes. 
Because they are feminists read the fking article there are more information that details their beliefs. Do some work and get information. I am done providing you everything do not be entitled princess.
I did a search for the word feminist in both articles. Both came up with no matches. 
Even if Pauline Nyiramasuhuko is a feminist what does that have to do with it Individuals who commit crimes dont do it on behalf of all feminists. Thats like blaming Valerie Solanass attempted murder of Andy Warhol on all feminists at the time.
Your original statement was feminists must be prosecuted for several decades of hate crimes. That comes across as feminists as a group. Im not responsible for the Rwanda genocide or the attempted murder of Andy Warhol. Please be more concise in your wording if thats not what you meant.
because feminists are very very angry volatile fringe group of people. We have so many the list does not stop at herman harriet adele mercier valeri solanas dwarkin and there are many more they are all feminists with anti male male hating bipolar world view in their heart and mind.
bipolar world view What What does mental illness have to do with feminism Its an illness that can strike anyone.
Eventually women are getting tired of it and women are the ones who would ask for prosecution of feminists for committing hate crimes you watch.
Youre dreaming. As more people not just feminists rally to denounce rape culture and insist on justice for victims of sexual violence MRAs are getting angrier and more volatile. Its going to blow up in your faces I guarantee it.
Dworkin was astoundingly bigoted person and yet NOW which SourceWatch calls the largest feminist organization in America was very supportive of her during her life and calls her one of feminisms most rigorous minds. She was one of their most prominent members but even so if they care at all about equality they should finally denounce her. Whats dangerous is that many of todays gender activists cite her as a major influence.
I am also surprised since male enrollment is decreasing in the universities how come rape culture which is males sexually assaulting females is prevailing in universities and what kind of parents are sending their daughters to universities where rape culture is prevalent. I say male and females avoid universities at any cost. The risk for getting education is not worth it.
Propaganda tells people what they want to hear there will be no opposition. Women dont view men as human its a an acceptable and maybe even necessary attitude when womens position is weak but when their vote counts the same it produces tyranny
And of course NO people are outraged at the growing number of men who are having their lives ruined because they dared to have drunken sex with a girl who was also drunk and then having rape cried on them when she wakes up and regrets her decision. 
It doesnt matter that he was also drunk he has peni s and thus is automatically guilty. 
Wheres the outrage America If Americas favorite daughters were having their lives ruined people would be up in arms about it.
If a guy claimed rape waking up to a chick when he was drunk the night before everyone would laugh at him and rightfully so in most cases. It should be the same way in reverse. Yes a drunken hookup is different then having sex with someone who is passe dout.
The first example citied in this article is the kind of pseudo rape that has me terrified for my son when he goes to college. Yes she said she didnt want to at THAT moment so when he tried again knowing she would say NO if she wanted him to stop like she did the first time and she didnt he took it for a nonverbal yes. Her agency wasnt removed from her she deliberately let the event happen. She was not forced not prevented from leaving or talking or swatting him away. She chose to stay in bed and let him have sex with her. She ignored her OWN feelings and let it happen. Letting people do things to you when you are NOT forced to let them is NOT the same as being victim to an abusive crime. Women and girls are accountable for their actions or inactions when the other party is NOT using force other than perseverance and gentle persuasion. Rape is violence it happens to both women and men by both men and women and rapists are not people trying to have sex they are people trying to lash out and hurt others. I am so tired of this oneway discourse.
Women are treated as little children in our society who are not allowed to grow up by gender ideologues.
As a career man who once dated a bored nonworking girlfriend I cant tell you how many times Ive come home late at night exhausted and been subjected to the EXACT SAME interplay in the first example.
Being a giving boyfriend Id eventually provide at least something to alleviate her boredom. Under this ridiculous definition apparently ive been raped too many times to count. 
To this I say certainly not. If you give in to persistence in the absence of force or coercive threats its not rape. 
Its very telling that one of the people leading a lone campaign against this stupidity in California is a collegeaged girl who sees it for the baldfaced attack on masculinity it is and her happily married mother and father who dont sign contracts every time they share a bed.
This right here. The goal posts for what qualifies as rape has been getting lower and closer for years. We are now at the point where this movement is very clearly making an effort to criminalize as much male behaviour as possible. It is an attempt by Feminists to wedge government into your bedroom and stake a claim of jurisdiction over every possible grey area of common sexual conduct and hand it over to any women who chooses to find buyers remorse to be a courtsport. 
The major problem with the rape culture moniker is that it has rendered the term rape so nebulous and diffuse by attaching itself to almost any male sexual behaviour. Words lose their meaning if they are too broadly applied. I really think we need to make a huge distinction between situations like those described in these articles and violence of actual rape. Use of a different term such as sexual disagreement would be much more appropriate. Most of these girls sound confused and would benefit more from a mentor or counselor than a lawyer.
Most of these girls sound confused and would benefit more from a mentor or counselor than a lawyer.
Spare me the condescension. Its not about criminalizing male behaviour its about criminalizing predatory sexual behaviour that causes real emotional andor physical harm. It doesnt matter whether the aggressor is a man or woman.
Consent isnt rocket science. If youre not sure whether you have real consent dont risk continuing.
Do you give a receipt of consent every time you engage in sexual behaviour 
If youre not sure whether you have real consent dont risk continuing.
I have been in many situations where either I or the other party did not explicitly give consent through words. 
Please forgive my lack of understanding but Ive known many women who complain about a jerk for days after they were smoothly and willingly talked into sex. How does consent prevent this kind of activity
Teach your son to stop when a woman says to stop and let that be the end of the matter. Then you and he wont have to worry about someone accusing him of rape when he doesnt stop after she says no.
But hey people who hang around AVFM like both of you live on fiction to fuel thier anger.
You know everyone who visits AVFM so much more than an actual member knowing other members it seems you hang around AVFM a lot more than any one else. Good for us keep following us and do not forget to comment wherever we go. We love to expose sexist and bigots like you right around the public.
Its always helpful to keep on top of the current lies misogyny and racism so Im not surprised when I see it regurgitated elsewhere.
You are correct that unfortunately this attitude spreads farther then just feminism.
Feminists dont preach that. Its a narrative made up by misogynists and other rape apologists.
Its the feminist version of equality in where women are more equal than men.
Feminist Yes but equal rights are not enough. We want equality of outcome as well. Even if it is forced.Man Whoa Thats not equality. If anything thats superiority. How do you intend to do thatFeminist Victimhood is power. When you whine about victimization people tend to sympathize with you.Feminist Then we use this sympathy to acquire the victim status. We also throw domestic violence violence against women et al the mix.Feminist This enables us to have the victim card. Once you have the victim card skys the limit. No one dares question your demands.Feminist And then we use this to further any and every agenda that we have. Easy peasy.Man But victimhood does not justify privileges. Female victimhood has nothing to do with women being provided privileges in every domain.Feminist Yes but because of the ingrained chivalry in men it does it does justify privileges for women.Feminist Most men do not perceive that Chivalry means defending women against evils not defending womens evils. They always jump to our rescue and white knight for us and give us anything we demand.Man This is where you are mistaken Ms. Feminist. You underestimate the male intellect.
David King a moderator on Avoiceformen is a white knight and a selfconfessed Equity feminist.
The thing is rape hysteria hurts real rape victims also. These feminists dont care about those raped they just want to demonize men pure and simple.
I had already said no. I was just tired and wanted to go to bed. I let him finish. I pulled my panties back on and went to sleep.
Yeah that is clearly not rape. Remember rape is a horrible crime second only to murder in severity its not something you allow to happen simply because youre tired and want to sleep. Can you imagine letting someone dismember you simply because you were to sleepy to argue about it Can you imagine letting some steal your TV or murder your dog simply because you wanted to sleep No Then you cant with any reasonable sanity say I let him rape me because I was too tired to say no again.
Swarthmore should just get it over with and go ahead and put that in their student handbook.
This is COMPLETELY about money. A place like Swarthmore will settle a Title IX lawsuit for a pile of cash think K rather than risk a jury trial and also get all the bad publicity. The attorney gets . Swarthmore has a . billion endowment. These girls and their lawyers want some of it and are happy to lie theres never any actual evidence just graphic accusations and tearjerking and destroy some college boys life because its very profitable. Period.
You do realize that Title IX is only applicable in the U.S. right And that rape occurs to people who arent in college
So This is COMPLETELY about money is only applicable to the U.S. It was a ridiculous illogical statement.
The article is in Philadelphia Magazine about a Pennsylvania college. Learn how to read.
You have never seen a show or book that has a large female viewership where a woman says no once to see if the guy is a real man and wont take no as an answer. You could consider that rape but it is definately of a different severity then a violent rape. Just like assaults can be varying degrees.
With a large female viewship Id say that holds true regardless of the target audience but especially if its men.
Generally the law assigns a higher degree of severity when there are threats force or a weapon involved.
If youre talking U.S. law and PIV sex of course it isnt. Its still sexual assault.
Auntie Alias doesnt think that personhood applies to men. She repeats the hateful assertion that men cant get raped during PIV intercourse. I truly hope you dont have a son because your attitude towards men and boys is disgusting.
You conveniently ignored that I was talking about the law. Men cant legally be raped through forced PIV intercourse in the U.S. because the FBIs definition of rape doesnt include it. Men cant legally be raped in Canada because there is no such charge as rape. Rape and sexual assault are repugnant no matter who the victim is. It takes a terrible emotional toll.
A study found that one in four Canadian women will be sexually assaulted during her lifetime. J. Brickman and J. Briere incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault in an Urban Canadian Population The International Journal of Womens Studies Vol. no. 
Nearly in women and in men in the U.S. have been raped at some time in their lives.
in women aged has experienced some form of sexual violence since the age of .
The CDC study is based on terrible methodology and has been discredited most recently by Christina Hoff Sommers in her factual feminist series you should check it out on youtube.
The in myth originated from an infamous survey by radical feminist Mary Koss and has subsequently become a factoid that wont die. Its a preposterous statistic recently repeated by the White House but it fits the hard line feminist narrative so its become unP.C to question.
As for the legal morass that punishes male victims of female rape guess which groups fight against justice and equality for men Guess which groups want to abolish womens prisons and reduce womens sentences even further for identical crimes Gender feminism has become a hate movement thats a sad shadow of its former self. How do I define rape culture Certainly not one where less than of men are responsible for all rapes and rapists are despised and where the incidence of rape is at a historically tiny number. in or women being the victim of sexual assault is still far too high and victim blaming is evil and needs to be stamped out but it doesnt help to perpetuate male vilifying myths that have no basis in reality.
I see. So the CDC is wrong when it supports what feminists say but when it suits the MRA agenda its right. Im not interested in anything Christina Hoff Sommers has to say.
Guess which groups want to abolish womens prisons and reduce womens sentences even further for identical crimes
That is one of the most bizarre claims Ive heard. The only ones I hear talking about it are MRAs. 
Rape culture isnt about the frequency of rape its the attitudes about rape and that includes victimblaming.
Well right back at you. Youve cherry picked activist research from the International Journal of Womens Studies what are the chances that Mary Kosss survey appears in the footnotes and now youre bizarrely claiming that rape culture has nothing to do with the frequency of rape Youre not interested in facts or data because it never was about evidence just some ineffable culture that cant be disproven.
Re rape culture not everything in the world has to be scientifically proven to be valid. We cant prove or disprove the existence of racism either. That doesnt make it any less real. The ones who deny racism exists are the ones who dont want to held accountable for perpetuating it. The people who deny rape culture dont want rapists to be held accountable.
As any logical person could see the study is designed with a gender biased views in the center obviously a result would suggest a strong gender bias but if a gender neutral survey is designed then a different picture emerges the one that says human beings are imperfect and people are not bad but individuals are bad and the problems are human problems not gender problems. You can see the dishonesty here where insertion vagina is defined as sex assault but enveloping penis is not. It is as if people already have the end result in mind and they merely designed a survey to fit their result. If you say equal and equal terms then why you would not approach it in equal and fair terms This is called intellectual dishonesty and one can clearly see these intellectually dishonest people belong to a particular ideological belief system where bias against opposite gender is rampant and sits in the core of that belief system. 
It has run its course since it is currently being run by extremist group of people who are taking it to extreme at an exponential rate that feminism is on fast paced to meet expiry date as it happened in history in these situations. Unfortunately feminists can not engineer future since nature has its own way of reacting back and eventually history would repeat itself which is people would stand against unfairness injustice dictatorship etc. And what is great is that both men and women are taking stand against it as it happened throughout the history the same men and women who took care of each other throughout the history and that something can not change because its natures forces at work.
Wait the CDC did quantify made to penetrate and categorized it as sexual violence. How is that biased
Among women rape includes vaginal oraal or anaal penetration by a male using his penis. Italso includes vaginal or anaal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object.Among men rape includes oraal or aanal penetration by a male using his penis. It alsoincludes anaal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object. 
I realize that but it does account for cases of made to penetrate. The numbers are there so what does it matter how its classified from a statistical standpoint
Say what Are you crazy or something If men penetrate then it is rape and women force men to penetrate i.e. envelopes mens penis then it is not One is charged with rape and other is charged with sexual assault. You are a rape apologist just like Adele Mercier.
I cant help how the FBI and the CDC define rape The numbers for made to penetrate are available in the study so theyre not hiding anything.
That is one of the most bizarre claims Ive heard. The only ones I hear talking about it are MRAs.
Those articles show that two women think that way. The original question was Guess which groups want to abolish womens prisons and reduce womens sentences even further for identical crimes Your articles dont prove that feminists AS A GROUP endorse the idea.
Woman said no. He raped her. He didnt respect the FACT she said no. NO means NO. Here come the MRAs from A Voice for Misogynists to whine and bellyache about male sexuality being demonized by uh teaching consent Amazing how that works innit Consent is something men dont want to deal with because they know they coerce women. Thats what theyre all upset about. I say we teach consent everywhere. No finally has to mean no.
One study in which less than boys and men participated and no equivalent study where the same questions were put to girls and women do not prove your point of equivalence.
Only a small percentage of cases are referred to the FBI so the Innocence Project figures cant be extrapolated to all cases. Nowhere does the writer claim false accusations are close to .
if inconclusive DNA is added. Author does say false rape cases is percent when inconclusive DNA is added.
It must be stressed that the sexual assault referrals made to the FBI ordinarily involve cases where identity is at issue there is no consent defense the nonDNA evidence linking the suspect to the crime is eyewitness identification the suspects have been arrested or indicted based on nonDNA evidence and the biological evidence sperm has been recovered from a place vaginalrectaloral swabs or underwear that makes DNA results on the issue of identity virtually dispositive.
Notice the part about the absence of a noconsent defense These cases involve the identification of suspects so naturally the exclusion rate by DNA analysis is going to be high. Most victims know their rapists so identification is not the issue consent is. Thats why the results cant be extrapolated to all cases.
Note the part about systemic barriers. That alludes to rape culture. They arent denying it but they are claiming its not responsible. Most feminists think that statement is garbage.
of Men and of Women reported seexual coercion by their most recent heterosexual partner . of Men reported forced vagynal seex vs . of Women . of Men reported forced oraal or anaal sex vs . of Women.
I dont have access to Springer articles and I dont see what youre quoting in the abstract. Its a study conducted with men so how could it have stats on womens experiences
Then get the fking access. I pay money to read peer reviewed research articles because I am interested in truth. Also look on Google it has been discussed on the web. Now move your lazy ass.
Dont curse at me because Im not willing to spend money to review the study you pointed to.
Who made you the language nanny You accuse men of the vilest crimes but get your panties all in bunch over a word Youre a totalitarian supremacist.
Yeah thats the thing I dont get here. She said no and he kept trying. Why is this being held up as an example of How Awful Things Have Become When she says no youre done bro get the hell out of bed.
The fatal flaw in this article is the focus on the victims actions instead of the perpetrators. She said no. He ignored it and carried on. Thats the part the courts care about.
Its clear in the example above that she did resist until such resistance was futile. She could have kept saying no. She could have gotten up and left. She could have kneed him in the nuts to make her point Instead she consented to sex so that she could go to sleep. 
Rape is a horrible and violent crime you dont allow horrible violence to be done to you simply because you want to go to sleep Saying that this example is rape trivializes the experience of real rape victims.
In my nonlegal opinion once the woman quoted in the article said no it was incumbent on her partner to ensure that a change of heart on her part was clear and unambiguous. Judging by her description her partner was wilfully blind to her lack of consent.
From the same source I linked above.. Consent is either express or implied. Express when it is given viva voce or in writing implied when it is manifested by signs actions or facts or by inaction or silence which raise a presumption that the consent has been given.
The bottom line is a person doesnt just allow horrible violence to be committed against them just because they want to get to sleep. If I was on a jury I would have to rule that there was implied consent because she had many other options other than letting him do his thing just so she could get some sleep.. 
I can agree that he should acted poorly and he should have stopped. but this situation just doesnt rise to the level an extremely violent crime that warrants sending this young man to jail for years and years.
Whoa can we agree that a legal dictionary isnt the final word on the subject The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled there is no such thing as implied consent. I dont know about how thats treated in the U.S. but dont imagine things are that much different.
You keep mentioning how extreme and violent rape is. Rape is violent because its a violation of ones body. Its not necessary to threaten or restrain or beat a victim for it to be a violent act. The act of unwanted touching is also sexual violence. I certainly hope you arent going to claim it isnt.
can we agree that a legal dictionary isnt the final word on the subject yet you guys bring dictionary definition to define your feminism when actions say otherwise.
The supreme court of Canada is hardly the authority on law in the USA. Its about as valid as if I quoted a legal decision from Russia. 
And no I dont think unwanted touching is necessarily violence. Touching someones shoulder to get their attention is NOT the same as punching someone in the face. To say the situation in the article is the same as violently assaulting someone is like saying picking up a dollar bill off the sidewalk is the same as robbing someone at gunpoint. Or that calling someone a bad word is the same as attempted murder. Its absurd.
you dont allow horrible violence to be done to you simply because you want to go to sleep
You dont give people fatal electric shocks just because someone told you that it was an experiment and theyd be OK either.

The lawyer representing three of the men charged with the gang rape and murder of a medical student aboard a moving bus in New Delhi has blamed the victims for the assault saying he has never heard of a respected lady being raped in India.
Manohar Lal Sharmas comments come as Indians have reacted with outrage to the opinions of politicians and a religious preacher who have accused westernized women of inviting sexual assaults. Sharma said the male companion of the murdered yearold was wholly responsible for the incident as the unmarried couple should not have been on the streets at night.
Until today I have not seen a single incident or example of rape with a respected lady Sharma said in an interview at a cafe outside the Supreme Court in Indias capital. Even an underworld don would not like to touch a girl with respect.
Sharmas comments highlight frequently aired attitudes toward women in India. Activists say reporting of sex crimes and police investigations of rape are hindered by a tendency to blame the victim for not following the traditional conservative social roles ascribed to women.
This is the mentality which most Indian men are suffering from unfortunately said Ranjana Kumari director for the New Delhibased Centre for Social Research. That is the mindset that has been perpetrating this crime because they justify it indirectly you asked for it so it is your responsibility.
A spiritual guru Asharam sparked an outcry earlier this week when he said the New Delhi victim was equally responsible and should have chanted Gods name and fallen at the feet of the attackers to stop the assault.
Mohan Bhagwat the head of the proHindu Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that underpins the countrys main opposition political party said rapes only occur in Indian cities not in its villages because women there adopt western lifestyles.
Sharma said the man and woman should not have been traveling back late in the evening and making their journey on public transport. He also said it was the mans responsibility to protect the woman and that he had failed in his duty.
The man has broken the faith of the woman Sharma said yesterday. If a man fails to protect the woman or she has a single doubt about his failure to protect her the woman will never go with that man.
Sharma a Supreme Court lawyer for the last two decades says that his clients are innocent.
This is a very complicated case and the matter has not been solved yet he said. Police have said they have DNA evidence linking all six to the crime.
The defendants were brought into court today protected by more than police for a brief hearing. Sharma said the court was adjourned after he had filed an application requesting the charge sheet be given to the men in Hindi rather than English. The next court date will be Jan. .
Ram Singh the driver of the bus and the alleged ringleader is struggling to communicate and fluctuating between crying and laughing Sharma said. Sharma who has also been appointed to represent Singhs brother Mukesh and Akshay Kumar Singh who is unrelated plans to challenge police over their handling of the evidence.
Sharmas appointment comes after chaotic scenes on Jan. that forced the magistrate to order a private hearing over concerns for the safety of the accused. Sharma was one of two lawyers denounced by other advocates for volunteering to represent the defendants. Arguments and scuffles over his offer led the magistrate to order the court room be cleared and future sessions to be held behind closed doors.
The gang rape of the woman on Dec. provoked a sustained and charged debate about the safety of women in the worlds biggest democracy. The brutality of the crime and allegations by the male friend of the victim that it took police minutes to respond to calls outraged the nation.
Describing the victims battle for life her father said in an interview with British television channel ITV yesterday that he was initially optimistic that she would survive the attack. He said his daughters ambition was to be a doctor.
Her main aim was that our family wouldnt have to suffer any more the father said his face blurred by the channel to protect his identity.
The attack on the woman and her friend which led to her death almost two weeks later forced the government to address demands for swifter justice safer streets and heavier sentences in rape cases. Indias top court on Jan. began considering demands for faster trials and the suspension of lawmakers accused of sex crimes.
Sharma said he met the defendants for the first time on Jan. for minutes and was due to talk with them again yesterday. The three defendants he is representing put their thumb prints on forms appointing Sharma as their lawyer because they are illiterate according to a copy of the documents given to Bloomberg News.
Five of the six accused will be tried for abduction rape and murder among other charges government prosecutor Rajiv Mohan said Jan. . The other said to be a juvenile has been appearing before a separate judicial panel.
The male friend of the woman who was repeatedly raped and brutalized aboard the bus last month has recounted the twohour attack which ended with the couple being thrown on to the roadside ignored by passersby and argued over by police.
In a Jan. interview with the Zee News television channel the man who along with the rape victim hasnt been officially identified described how they were lured on to the bus operating illegally on the night of Dec. as they returned home from a movie theater in a southern neighborhood of the Indian capital.
The six men aboard the bus which had tinted windows and curtains had laid a trap for us he told the channel. They beat us up hit us with an iron rod snatched our clothes and belongings and threw us off the bus on a deserted stretch. The woman who was flown to Singapore for medical treatment died in the hospital Dec. .
Sharma says there are number of discrepancies in the polices version of the events which he will reveal in court. The only example he was willing to give is the failure of the police almost three weeks after the attack to determine whether one of the accused is a juvenile.
Sharma criticized the lawyers of a local district association who have said no advocates should represent the accused.
These people are just seeking revenge Sharma said. They are not seeking justice. A defendant has a right to a lawyer this is a basic principle of a modern society.
Jackie Selebi the national police commissioner said there were cases per people in compared with in . Selebi said rape statistics might be exaggerated because many rape cases were reported on a Friday and Saturday night only to be withdrawn on a Monday.
Its the withdrawal of cases that bears closer examination because it says nothing about women lying about rape as the ignorant might believe but it says everything about a society that fails women and children and is allowing HIVAids to proliferate without check. South Africa has the highest rates of rape in the world according to Interpol and the highest incidence of HIV. The National ProsecutingAuthority tells us that percent of all cases before South African courts are for rape except in Durban and Mdantsane where it is percent.
Although the Law Reform Commission estimates there are million rapes a year on average only rape survivors lay charges each year. Why It is because rape survivors are treated so badly by so many. Every time a rape survivor does not lay a charge she allows a rapist or rapists because percent of rape in South Africa is gang rape to believe he or they can do it again. And he or they will. Again and again until a rape survivor does battle with the police doctors psychologists and the courts to get the justice she deserves and to protect the next woman or child.
A Medical Research Council study into conditions for rape survivors in Gauteng in found that the treatment of survivors by police and medical and court personnel was deplorable. Two researchers were so traumatised by what they witnessed that they had to go for counselling.
Last year the cabinet removed Section from the new Sexual Offences Bill which would have given postexposure prophylaxis PEP which is medication to prevent HIV as well as medication to prevent STIs and pregnancy to rape survivors. They left in Section which guarantees medical care for the rapist and undertakes to rehabilitate any alcohol or narcotics addictions he might have.
Just over a month ago a yearold student was forced at knifepoint into an alley off Long Street Cape Town and was raped. When she went to Groote Schuur Hospital she like many rape survivors found it difficult to use the word rape.
take place less than hours after the first act of penetration or attempted penetration.
Her doctor being as incompetent as most GPs in dealing with rape survivors in part because most universities give scant training to medical students on how to deal with rape made her wait while he tried to figure out what medicines she should take. He finally gave her a prescription for two months of PEP instead of just days.
Superintendent Nico Snyman head of that police station says that despite a good arrest rate only a small percentage of cases get prosecuted because families will accept compensation from the rapist or rapists and the child is then prevented from testifying. In the case of a young man raped in Wentworth Durban three years ago when he was the thugs who raped him offered his impoverished grandmother R to get him to drop the case. She wanted the money but he refused despite continuing threats.
Investigating officers were changed three times the prosecutors four times. The victim went for counselling at a wellknown child counselling centre but because he is an orphan and his grandmother unemployed he couldnt afford bus fare to continue and no one bothered to go to him. Last week the case against the accused was dismissed for lack of evidence. The prosecutor did not add extortion to the charge sheet nor did she bother to get anyone to testify how he the victim took rat poison after the rape and spent a week in Addington Hospitals psychiatric ward because he was so traumatised.
The investigating officer was on leave and did not testify and no victim impact statement was used. Gangsters got away with the rape of a boy because no one cared and this was a case the National Prosecuting Authoritys Sexual Offences Unit received frequent complaints about.
A nineyear study by Cape Towns Red Cross Childrens Hospital published in the SA Medical Journal in December found that the average age of children raped was three. Research has shown that percent of those raped in South Africa are at risk of becoming HIVpositive if they do not receive PEP.
Experts believe that if postexposure prophylaxis was given immediately to rape survivors South Africa could cut new HIV transmission dramatically. Yet little is done to advance this HIV preventive mechanism. What are the costs of providing PEP The cost to the government of each HIV test is less than c according to the department of health. PEP costs it about R for days. In other words to treat reported rapes each year would cost the government less than R .
A rape specialist Dr Adrienne Wulfsohn says the hospital costs of treating one rape survivor who contracts HIV is around R during her shortened life. Better treatment of rape survivors would result in more reporting and would give them the confidence to go through with their cases. What is more most rapists are involved in other crimes you jail a rapist and you invariably put away a dangerous criminal responsible for other offences.

A man raped his girlfriend before raping her mother days later after breaking into her house and holding a knife to her throat a court has heard.
The mother who was at the time was saved when her daughter heard the rape taking place in the background of a voicemail the attacker accidentially left her.
The Waterford man who cannot be named to protect the womens identity has previously served a sentence for raping his daughter.
At the time of the attacks on his girlfriend and her mother he was on bail for kidnapping and seriously assaulting the same girlfriend the previous year. Last December he was jailed for three and a half years for the kidnapping. He faces the possibility of life imprisonment for the latest attacks. 
His defence counsel asked Mr Justice Patrick McCarthy to impose a determinate sentence so the man can work towards a target date. The judge adjourned finalisation until May rd.
The father of four pleaded guilty at the Central Criminal Court to rape of the two women in various ways between July nd and July th at locations in Dublin. He also pleaded guilty to false imprisonment attempted rape aggravated burglary making threats to kill and aggravated sexual assault.
Det Insp Paul Cleary told Kerida Naidoo SC prosecuting that the ordeal started after the accused became angry when his girlfriends mother refused to let him into their house. He went with his girlfriend to another location where they had sex during which the man became extremely violent.
Afterwards she felt she could not go home and went with the accused to his house.
Two days later the woman had a missed call and voicemail from the accused. In the background of message she could hear her mother saying Im so sorry Im so sorry and the accused speaking.
The man had earlier that evening forced his way into the house after the mother opened the door to him. He punched her and held a Stanley knife to her throat as he called her a whore and a slut.
He dragged the woman up the stairs by her hair before tying her up with the belts from two dressing gowns. Det Insp Cleary said that for the next two hours and minutes she was subjected to vicious physical and sexual assaults.
The accused spoke in a relatively calm voice as he called the woman names punched her and held the blade to her throat. He also sunk his teeth into her nose.
The woman passed out several times. She believed she was going to die and prayed that her daughter would not return home. During this time the man was repeatedly ringing her daughter with no answer.
Garda had been alerted by the womans daughter after she heard the voicemail. As officers banged on the door the accused told the woman he would kill her. Garda broke in and chased the man into the back garden where they used pepper spray after he refused to drop the knife.
Det Insp Cleary said the woman was left unbelievably traumatised afterwards.
Dominic McGinn SC defending said his client had instructed him not to minimise the seriousness of the offences. He said his client had some insight into his offending and was on the waiting list for psychological treatment in prison.

The move follows a week of turmoil on campus with demands for Purdue discipline for a series of social media posts

With Purdue University officials demanding an apology and hours before students planned to rally outside Hovde Hall to demand his firing for social media comments that prolife groups took as rape threats Jamie Newman left his job Monday morning.
Yeah I just quit Newman anaccompanist in Purdues Division of Dance wrote in an email to the JC. Tell the world.
Newman offered no other comment for publication. Purdue confirmed that Newman had submitted his resignation Monday effective immediately.
The university has accepted the resignation and believes this is the appropriate outcome said Julie Rosa a Purdue spokeswoman.
The move followed a week of turmoil on campus with students parents and alumni pressing Purdue to sanction Newman for a series of social media posts on a national prolife news site called LiveActionNews.org run by a group known for undercover sting videos aimed at compromising Planned Parenthood.
Those comments were tied back to frequent and critical comments Newman made on the Facebook page of Purdue Students for Life and that groups Hands Up Dont Abort fliers put up around the Purdue Black Cultural Center at the start of Black History Month.
All along Newman said allegations that he somehow threatened to rape Purdue students was a stretch and amounted to defamation of character. A Purdue University Police Department investigation launched after students filed a report found no criminal intent. And Purdue University citing free speech policies found no grounds to discipline or fire Newman.
Still on Friday Purdue attorney Steve Schultz issued a blistering rebuke of Newman saying that the only reason he still had his job was because of the universitys free speech policy.
The disruption weve endured as a community is entirely due to Mr. Newmans online posts Schultz said Friday evening. Anything other than a full apology and explanation from him about the intent of his statement will be insufficient to cure the harm hes done.
According to his letter to Schultz Newman said he has been the target of threats of violence since late last week.
Rosa said Purdue police received a report of threats made to Newman to his Purdue email account. She said a Purdue investigator spoke with Newman over the weekend to develop a safety plan. She said Purdue and West Lafayette police were working together to investigate the complaint.
On Monday Schultz declined to comment beyond the universitys official statement.
Students for Life of America the umbrella group over Purdue Students for Life had been critical of Newmans comments and the universitys reluctance to discipline or fire him for his social media posts. On Monday the organization didnt directly comment on Newmansresignationbut addressed claims about threats made against him.
This was a sad situation for all involved said Kristan Hawkins president of Students for Life of America. As a group who has experienced threats of violence ourselves we condemn all threats of violence against anyone for any reason.
On Monday afternoon Purdue President Mitch Daniels defended the university for calling out Newman to apologize but not going so far as to fire him. During a University Senate conversation about suggested changes to a free speech policy instituted in Daniels called Newmans posts the most explicit threat Ive seen in my three years at Purdue.
If we had not changed the policies the speaker would have been firedsummarily Daniels said. Only because of the liberalization of that policy did that person get a chance to explain himself and persuaded the law enforcement people that he was just spouting off that he really had no intent to do exactly what he said he wanted to do. Personally I think that was a better outcome.
Garen Bragg a senior in the Purdue Polytechnic Institute continued with a rally Monday afternoon outside Hovde Hall home of Purdues top administration including Daniels office. Early on the rally drew about a dozen students who chanted Rape is not a joke.
We feel we still have a point Bragg said. We were disappointed with the speed with which Purdue said they were not going to discipline this individual. He was a staff member at Purdue and what he said was inappropriate. We need to let Purdue know that.
Mike Young president of Purdue Student Government said a resolution calling for an apology and sanctions against Newman was going to be up for consideration Wednesday. The resignation settled that he said.
My only disappointment Young said Monday is that I wont get to sign the PSG resolution asking him to be fired with a big fat Sharpie.
As six men accused of raping a Swiss tourist who was cycling with her husband in central India appeared in court there is growing outrage after both police and a government official blamed the victim for the brutal attack.
A spokesperson for the state police sparked anger after seemingly saying the Swiss woman and her husband where partially to blame for the attack calling them careless for travelling to a remote part of the country.
No one stops there Madhya Pradesh police Inspector Avnesh Kumar Budholiya said according to The Independent. Why did they choose that place They were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They would have passed a police station on the way to the area they camped. They should have stopped and asked about places to sleep.
Those comments were echoed by the state governments home minister who said tourists were putting themselves at risk.
What happened is unfortunate for our nation. When foreign tourists come they should inform the SP Superintendent of Police about their plans Uma Shankar Gupta told the television news channel NDTV.
The suspects appeared in the magistrates court in Madhya Pradesh state with their faces covered with black cloth police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said.
It was not clear how they pleaded in court but during their arrest Sunday they confessed to the crime police said. The men who are poor farmers from nearby villages also face additional charges of robbing the Swiss couple.
The attack which occurred Friday night as the couple camped in a forest in Datia district came three months after the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus which spurred outrage over the treatment of women in Indian society and the countrys justice system.
The Swiss couple told police that the woman had been raped by seven or eight men but that it was dark and they could not be sure of the exact number.
The men beat up the husband tied him to a tree before raping the woman police said. They also stole the couples cellphone laptop computer and rupees . Police said they recovered the laptop and phone from one of the suspects.
The Swiss tourists were on a threemonth India holiday and had visited the temple town of Orchha. They were planning to cycle to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal about kilometres away.
They set out from Orchha on Friday and pitched their tent in the forest near Jatia village when they were attacked by men armed with sticks police said.
Last month the Swiss government issued a travel notice for India that included a warning about increasing numbers of rapes and other sexual offences in the South Asian nation and the latest incident could prompt other countries to issue similar warnings.
On Monday the Press Trust of India news agency reported that the yearold woman said she will stay in India for now to help the investigation. There was no immediate confirmation and phone calls to the Swiss Embassy went unanswered.
After last Decembers bus attack the government passed a law increasing prison terms for rape from the existing seven to years to a maximum of years. The law provides for the death penalty in cases of rape that result in death or leave the victim in a coma. It has also made voyeurism stalking acid attacks and the trafficking of women punishable under criminal law.

An UberX driver allegedly assaulted her after picking her up at an Old City bar.
A Philadelphiawoman and her husband have filed a lawsuit against Uber and a former UberX driver claiming that she was raped in the mans UberX vehicle last year. 
The woman told police that she was picked up in Old City on February and that the UberX driver held down her arms ripped her pants and raped her. She said he drove her around for more than two hours before letting her out of the car and she filed a police report the same day as the alleged attack.
At the time of our article the Philadelphia Police Department indicated that the investigation was still open. More than one year later the department confirms there still hasnt been an arrest.
In the lawsuit the woman reiterates the main allegations and also sheds light on more of the circumstances of that night. She had been attending an event sponsored by a running club at a bar at Secondand Market streets. When it came time to leave another member of the running club offered to get her an Uber ride home. According to her filing she was intoxicated.
The ride should have taken minutes based on the traffic conditions at the time states the lawsuit. After minutes the person who arranged the ride for her looked at the app and noticed that the driver was taking a very odd route to get from Secondand Market to her home in Northwest Philadelphia.
The lawsuit accuses Uber of negligence alleging that the company did not properly screen its driver and that the company does nothing to verify that the person behind the wheel is actually the authorized UberX driver. It also accuses Uber of failing to monitor its service. Had there been a dispatcher available she argues someone would have seen the message sent to the driver or noticed that the driver went way off course. The suit points out that the man allegedly held the woman captive in his car for at least minutes after the worried message was sent to the driver.
The woman also accuses Uber of misrepresentation arguing that Uber represents itself to be a safe and reliable means of transportation and touts itself as an empowering choice when bars close and that it is the safe choice at the end of the night. The suit cites Ubers . safe rides surcharge. Theres also an accusation of reckless disregard on Ubers part.
The suit also names former UberX driver Justin Hercules a yearold man from Northeast Philadelphia. The plaintiff accusesHercules of battery and false imprisonment but also allegesthat her actual assailant may have been a coconspirator. According to the suit the woman was unable to identify her attacker beyond a small low resolution picture of the individual identified as Hercules by Uber. The suit opens up the possibility that she was raped by someone using Hercules UberX app. Hercules has notbeen charged with thecrime. According to state records Hercules passed hislimousine license test on March and the Philadelphia Parking Authorityconfirms that he is a licensed limousine driver.
The woman says that she has suffered from extreme anxiety and night terrors among other conditions and that shes incurred expenses for hospital and psychiatric care and antiAIDS medication. According to the suit she was out of work for eight months as a result of the attack. She and her husband are seeking damages of at least .
When we approached Uber about this in March more than days after the original police report was filed the company told us that our call was the first they had heard about the allegations. They assured us that the company would suspend the drivers access pending the outcome of the investigation. Today we reached out to Uber again for comment on the lawsuit and to see if Hercules privileges had been restored and they told us theyd get back to us.

The twisted terror groups leader has issued a terrifying edict telling militants that repeatedly sexually abusing women is the best way to make them Muslim.
The sickening letter circulated amongst the groups warped fighters states that a woman automatically becomes Muslim if she is raped by at least different ISIS fighters.
It emerged as victims of the perverted hate group spoke out about its infamous sex slave markets where twisted militants can buy women for as little as a packet of cigarettes.
ISIS fighters have previously executed women who refused to have sex with them with many experts saying most young men joining the group are more interested in sex than Islam or jihad.
Many of the women come from the Yazidi religious sect and have been horrendously defiled and mutilated by Islamist fanatics who believe they indulge in devil worship.
One of them known as Noor revealed how a crazed jihadi showed her the letter from ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi as a form of justification before brutally raping her.
The yearold was sold into slavery after ISIS overran her village in the Iraqi province of Sinjar.
Horrifyingly she revealed how the militant then passed her on to of his friends so that they could also raped her in the name of their warped ideology.
This shows any captured women will become Muslim if ISIS fighters rape her. 
ISIS has repeatedly looked to justify the rape of Yazidi and other nonMuslim women which it claims is done in the name of jihad.
In reality many believe it is a desperate bid to keep its mercenary militants happy at a time when they are being killed in their scores by Russian airstrikes and are seeing their salaries slashed as ISIS coffers run dry.
In its online English language magazine the group states that its fighters should rape any woman who mocks the Quran which they define as any nonMuslim.
Theologians across the world have repeatedly pointed out that none of ISIS actions have any justification or basis in Islam.
Londonbased Imam Ajmal Masroor said the terrorists have hijacked the religion in an attempt to justify their own depraved desires.
In Islam taking anyone as captive mistreating them using them as sex slaves torturing them and killing them is totally prohibited.
Thats exactly what they have demonstrated. There is no room for any discussion on this. Its haram forbidden its antiIslam and it should be treated as such.
ISIS has been on the run in recent weeks with Russian bombers sent into Syria by Vladimir Putin obliterating outposts in a matter of hours.
Yesterday it emerged that the hate group is becoming increasingly desperate for fighters as more and more civilians become wise to the flagrant lies its online propaganda machine pumps out.
Indian children participate in a protest against child abuse and rising crimes against women in Bhubaneswar India on March . Biswaranjan RoutAssociated Press 
Indias parliament has passed a sweeping new law to protect women against sexual violence in response to a brutal December gang rape in New Delhi.
The new law which still requires the presidents signature before it becomes official makes stalking voyeurism and sexual harassment a crime. It also provides for the death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the victims death. The law also makes it a crime for police officers to refuse to open cases when they receive complaints of sexual attacks.
Activists hailed the law as a milestone in Indias womens rights movement even as they raised concerns over some of its provisions as well as the countrys poor record of law enforcement.
Its a significant moment. We have taken many steps forward said Vrinda Grover a senior lawyer and a womens rights activist. Much much more needs to be done.
The bill was passed Thursday by the upper house of Indias parliament two days after the lower house approved it.
The law was hurried through parliament after the Dec. gang rape sparked nationwide protests demanding the government do more to safeguard women.
The government set up a panel headed by a retired judge which recommended sweeping changes to Indias laws governing crimes against women. The Cabinet quickly passed an ordinance incorporating some of those suggestions but parliament had to pass a new law by next month or the ordinance would have expired. Many lawmakers complained that the law was being rushed through without the proper debate or opportunity for amendment.
Speaking in parliament Home Affairs Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said the new law was the most stringent effort to curb sexual violence ever in India.
But Ranjana Kumari a womens activist and director of the Center for Social Research thinktank said significant problems remain especially the governments refusal to criminalize marital rape.
If bodily integrity is the issue and consent is the issue than certainly rape in marriage should be included she said.
She also criticized the year maximum sentence for acid attacks as too light and said the governments decision to make the age of consent was out of touch with the sexual mores of modern youth.
While she praised much of the law as a huge victory Kumari worried that an insensitive police force and overburdened judiciary could make it difficult to enforce.
The laws passage came less than a week after police said a Swiss tourist was gangraped in central India.
Grover said the law sent an important signal that India will no longer tolerate this type of behaviour but there now needs to be a sustained effort to change attitudes toward women across the country.
When you are fighting sexual violence against women you are not just fighting crimes. You are also fighting impunity and prejudice she said.

Its now been revealed Gaddafis victims include hundreds of teenage girls who throughout his year reign were beaten raped and forced to become his sex slaves.
IT HAS been more than two years since the capture and death of Muammar Gaddafi the Libyan dictator whose reign subjected an impoverished people to four decades of murder and terror. When the bedraggled former leader was hauled out of a drainpipe and shot in October his death ended the bloody NATOled civil war that had ravaged the country since the start of that year.
The full horror of his brutality has been slow to emerge with many Libyans still fearing retaliation by those who continue to be loyal to their late leader. But it can now be revealed that the most heartbreaking of Gaddafis victims include hundreds possibly thousands of teenage girls who throughout his year reign were beaten raped and forced to become his sex slaves.
Many were virgins kidnapped from schools and universities and kept prisoner for years in a specially designed secret sex lair hidden within Tripoli University or his many palaces.
In the months since he was deposed Gaddafis den where he regularly raped girls as young as has remained locked. But today its gaudy interior where the colonel brutalised his victims can be seen for the first time in photographs from a hardhitting BBC documentary.
Inside the small nondescript singlestorey complex the girls were forced to watch pornography to educate them for their degrading treatment at the hands of Gaddafi. And even those who did manage to escape were often shunned by their deeply religious Muslim families who believed their family honour had been tainted.
When the dictators body was dragged through the streets by a baying mob just hours after he was beaten and shot in the head the hastily convened transitional government moved swiftly to seal off the sex dungeon. They feared the full extent of Gaddafis debased and lewd lifestyle would horrify the Western world and cause deep embarrassment to Libya.
One of the rooms holds little more than a double bed lit by an orange lamp. Its s decor and grimy jacuzzi all left exactly as they were when Gaddafi last used it give it a seedy and gloomy air. But even more chilling is the clinical gynaecological suite in an adjoining room. It was here on two beds fitted with stirrups behind a table laden with surgical instruments that Gaddafis young victims were examined to ensure they had no sexually transmittable diseases. And here they were forced to undergo abortions if they became pregnant.
They however were the lucky ones. Other young victims were so badly abused that they were dumped in car parks and on waste ground and left to die.
Gaddafis modus operandi was to tour schools and universities where female students were invited to his lectures. As he spoke before his hushed audience he would silently scan the room seeking out attractive girls. Before leaving he would pat those he had selected on the head. Within hours his private bodyguards would round up those chosen and kidnap them. If their families tried to keep them from Gaddafis clutches they were gunned down.
One teacher at a Tripoli school recalled how the girls were all very young. Some were only she said. They would simply take the girl they wanted. They had no conscience no morals not an iota of mercy even though she was a mere child.
One mother whose daughter was a student said the community around Tripoli University lived in fear when a visit from the colonel was announced.
One just disappeared and they never found her again despite her father and brothers searching for her. Another was found three months later cut raped and lying in the middle of a park. She had been left for dead.
Even today the Libyan people are afraid to speak openly about Gaddafis depravity fearing reprisals from his former henchmen.
But one woman who was repeatedly raped by the despot over seven years from the age of has anonymously spoken of how he terrorised and abused her. She had been chosen to present the colonel with a bouquet when he toured her school in his home town of Sirte on the Mediterranean coast miles east of Tripoli.
When he patted her head afterwards in an apparently paternal gesture she thought she had pleased the man she and her fellow Libyans were forced to call the Guide.
She was raped repeatedly during the seven years she was held captive eventually escaping when a door was accidentally left unlocked.
Fuelled by cocaine and alcohol and often Viagra Gaddafi abused her horribly.
I will never forget that first time that moment she says. He violated my body and pierced my soul with a dagger. That blade will never come out.
It took the documentarymakers months of negotiations to be allowed access to information on Gaddafi as Libya remains secretive and hidebound by bureaucracy.
An interior view of the house of Aisha Gaddafi daughter of Libyas former leader Muammar Gaddafi.
But they also established that Gaddafi set up a murder for hire team run from Havana to rid him of enemies around the world.
He often stored the bodies of those killed in Libya in freezers so that he could regularly view them.
If Gaddafi was powercrazed he was also paranoid. A Brazilian plastic surgeon found himself escorted deep inside a bunker in Tripoli in the middle of the night in order to remove fat from Gaddafis belly and inject it into his increasingly wrinkled face.
Despite the pain Gaddafi refused a general anaesthetic fearing he might be poisoned and because he wished to remain alert.
Halfway through the operation he stopped to have a hamburger. He also created an elite squad of bodyguards all female whom he used for sex and forced to watch multiple barbaric executions.
For decades Gaddafi surrounded himself with these beautiful young women. Dressed in closefitting military uniforms with manicured nails and perfectly coiffed hair they exuded glamour while toting guns.

The commonlaw crime of rape involved a man having carnal knowledge of a woman not his wife through force and against her will and required at least slight penetration of the penis into the vagina. While some states maintain essentially this definition of rape most have broadened its scope especially in terms of the sex of the persons and the nature of the acts involved. Marital status is usually irrelevant. Moreover the crime is codified under various names including first degree sexual assault sexual battery unlawful sexual intercourse and first degree sexual abuse.

Her killing has prompted government promises of better protection for women and deep soulsearching in a nation where horrifying gangrapes are commonplace and sexual harassment is routinely dismissed as Eveteasing.
Several thousand people massed again yesterday in the centre of the Indian capital some to express sympathy for the victim who had been out to watch a film with her boyfriend others to voice anger at the government.

Protesters and the Indian media have demanded that the government unveil measures to make the country safer for women while introspecting on how to uproot deep prejudice and misogyny in Indian society.
Initial government proposals include a public register for sex offenders and forcing convicted rapists to undergo chemical castration the use of drugs to suppress sexual urges.

Jeffery promised an immediate increase in the number of courts to handle the surge of horrific sex abuse crimes.
The young victim was raped in Galeshewe a township in Kimberley on November just a day after the launch of the annual Days of Activism Against Women and Child Abuse.
The baby who was left in intensive care as a result of her ordeal was allegedly raped by her yearold uncle.
Brigadier Masebueng Mochologi of the Northern Cape police said yesterday the little girl was now out of ICU after undergoing surgery and was recovering well in a general ward at a Kimberley hospital.
The babys story stirred an outburst of rage across the country that has been unequalled since the brutal rape of a ninemonth old baby in Upington also in the Northern Cape during .
The rape resulted in the baby who was named baby Tshepang meaning hope to undergo reconstruction surgery. The mothers boyfriend was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime.
Generally in all such cases the children were not raped by a stranger but people they know Jeffery told The Citizen in an exclusive interview this week.
Unfortunately it is not possible to have a policeman in each and every house. He said heavy sentences do not seem to deter perpetrators.
We have already introduced the minimum sentence. We are now working towards ensuring that the vulnerable groups have a less traumatic experience when they come to court through the introduction of more sexual offences courts Jeffery said.
He said six new sexual offences courts will be opened this month. A total of courts will be opened by March and this will bring the number of the specialised courts to countrywide. He said the courts will be regularly monitored by officials including the minister.

NEW DELHI The condition of a yearold girl who was raped tortured and then left alone in a locked room for two days has improved a doctor said as protests continued in Indias capital over the authorities handling of the case.
The girl was in critical condition when she was transferred Thursday from a local hospital to the largest governmentrun hospital in the country. But D.K. Sharma medical superintendent of the staterun hospital in New Delhi where the girl was being treated said Sunday that she was responding well to treatment and that her condition had stabilized.
Police say the girl went missing April and was found two days later by neighbours who heard her crying in a locked room in the same New Delhi building where she lives with her family. The girl was alone when she was found having been left for dead by the man following the brutal attack police say.
A yearold man was arrested Saturday in the eastern state of Bihar about kilometres miles from New Delhi. After being flown to New Delhi he was in custody Sunday and was being questioned police said.
The attack came four months after the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus sparked outrage across India about the treatment of women in the country.
For the second consecutive day hundreds of people protested Sunday outside police headquarters in the capital angry over allegations that police had ignored complaints by the girls parents that she was missing.
About supporters of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party protested outside the home of the chief of the ruling Congress Party Sonia Gandhi demanding that the government ensure the safety and security of women and girls in the city.
The protesters also demanded that the Delhi police chief be removed from office and that police officials accused of failing to act on the parents complaint be dismissed.
Police and other officials that fail to do their jobs and instead engage in abusive behaviour should know that they will be punished Meenakshi Ganguly South Asia director of New Yorkbased Human Rights Watch said.
Police said they detained more than protesters when they tried to break down barricades on the road leading to Gandhis house. The protesters were released after a few hours.
Police also placed restrictions on the gathering of more than four people on the main avenue in the heart of New Delhi after university students said they planned to hold a demonstration there. Despite the police order about students gathered at New Delhis iconic India Gate monument and held a peaceful protest late Sunday.
Sexual crimes against women and children are reported every day in Indian newspapers and women often complain about their sense of insecurity when they leave their homes.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called for changes in attitudes toward women in India where there has been a fierce debate since Decembers fatal New Delhi gang rape about the routine mistreatment of females.
The gruesome assault on the little girl a few days back reminds us once again of the need to work collectively to root out this sort of depravity from our society Singh said Sunday at a meeting with civil servants.
A day earlier Singh had urged Indian society to look within and work to root out the evil of rape and other such crimes from our midst.
The fatal beating and gang rape of a young woman aboard a moving New Delhi bus sparked outrage and spurred the government to pass tough laws for crimes against women including the death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the victims death.
But activists say that merely passing strong laws is not enough and that the government has to convey its intention to crack down on crimes against women to its officials and the police.
Enacting strong laws are simply a first step but it needs the government to focus urgently on implementation if it is serious about protecting children and other victims of sexual abuse Human Rights Watchs Ganguly said.

A Dhaka magistrate gave the order meaning the yearold cricketer can be freed later Sunday or early Monday and join a practice session with the rest of Bangladeshs World Cup squad.
The court has granted him bail until the end of the World Cup Hossains lawyer Moniruzzaman Asad told AFP adding the order was granted in view of national interest since he has been a key player in the team.
The fast bowler was remanded in custody on Thursday in the latest twist to a sensational case over allegations that he raped Bengali actress Naznin Akter Happy.
Police last month launched a probe after Happy lodged a complaint that Hossain had backed away from an earlier pledge to marry her after a monthslong intimate affair.
The remand had placed a huge question mark over Hossains appearance in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand beginning in the middle of next month after selectors picked him in the man squad.
Authorities had even lined up a replacement for Hossain with Bangladeshi courts rarely granting bail in rape cases until formal charges are filed.
His tension is now over. He can join the practice with the World Cup squad from tomorrow Akram Khan the Bangladesh Cricket Board BCB head of operations told reporters.
After hearing the complaint a court ordered medical tests on Happy and told both the alleged victim and Hossain to undergo DNA tests.
The scandal has gripped the conservative Muslimmajority country for weeks with Happy telling reporters she would withdraw the case if Rubel agrees to marry her.
Although victims of alleged rapes are entitled to anonymity Happys decision to go public prompted police to waive the usual restrictions.
The fast bowler has rejected the accusations of rape or making a marriage proposal saying Happy was trying to blackmail him. He ruled out marrying the actress.
Happy became a household name for her debut movie Kichu Asha Bhalobasa Some Hopes Some Loves which hit cinemas in .
Rubel has played Tests for Bangladesh and taken wickets. He has also taken wickets in oneday international matches.

Thousands of Syrians fled to Jordans Zataari refugee camp to escape violence at home. But now women and children live in fear of kidnap rape and sham marriages in the camp meant to keep them safe.
Please wait while this video loads. If it doesnt load after a few seconds you may need to have Adobe Flash installed.
If agony has a sound it is the cry to God made by yearold Shahira as she sits broken and bereft in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.
In her black hijab she raises her hands to the sky almost unable to make sense of her own distress. Bashar Bashar she keeps crying. Why are you butchering us
Shahira is one of a hundred thousand Syrians whose home is now the sprawling tented city of Zataari. They fled the fighting to seek shelter and safety. But for many women the camp has offered them anything but.
Three girls in our camp were kidnapped explains Israa Mohammed. They raped them. Then they brought them back to the camp. The Jordanian guys they come to harass Syrian girls from the age of seven or six.
They see we dont have money. They want to exploit us. Give me your daughter for lira or lira. Its exploitation. Abu Sanad father
Such reports of women being kidnapped assaulted or raped abound around the camp. Women say security is non existent. They are too afraid even to go to the toilet at night alone.
I come with my daughter she enters and I stand here waiting for her says Um Hammad. There are girls who dont come to the toilet at night. We stay until the morning holding it in.
Um Majed pictured left is a Syrian housewife from Homs. She says she understands the refugee families and women who give into the demands of the men from the Gulf offering desperately needed cash. These are dark days for Syrians she offers up by way of reasoning.
She has chosen her own way to deal with such bleak times. She has become a marriage broker offering Syrian girls for sex.
He comes for a coffee and he sees her with her hijab he pays the dinar and leaves says Um Majed outlining the charges. If he wants to marry her he has to pay or more. He has to sign a marriage agreement and he takes her and even after one hour they can get divorced. Its none of my business. 
Frustrated by the authorities inability to deal with this problem residents of the camp are forming vigilante groups. They patrol the area they say to protect their women. They mete out their own justice on the men they decide are the perpetrators.
It is one of many problems the authorities now face. Young men angry frustrated and bored are running out of control. Several riots have broken out in the camp.
The United Nations says it is working hard with the Jordanian government to set up a proper policing structure and have announced a new security initiative.
But it may never ease the pain of the women refugees. That will only be soothed when they are allowed to go back to their beloved Syria.
Um Majed throws her head back and sighs. I wish to go back to Syria. I wish to breathe the air of my country. Inshallah I will go back.
But it is more in hope than expectation. She recognises what their future might hold.
I hope we dont have the same destiny of the Palestinians who went out of their country and never went back.
The film on the plight of Syrias refugees will be shown on Channel News on Thursday from pm. It was directed produced and filmed by Sharron Ward. The editor was Agnieszka Liggett.
As well as the fear of attack there is another more insidious assault on the women and girls of Zaatari. Men usually from Saudi Arabia and other gulf states are given free rein at the camp. Coming in the guise of benefactors offering charity in return many want a wife.
But these are marriages of convenience for the men at least. So called pleasure marriages they give cover a sheen of respectability to what is often wealthy men exploiting vulnerable women for sex.
What do they see us as A market place for selling Like selling sheep. They see we dont have money. They want to exploit us. Give me your daughter for lira or lira. Its exploitation.
The men often promise the earth. Lama says she was told she would live like a princess. But the reality often means a few days or weeks out of the camp then they are dumped alone in Jordan or left to come back to Zaatari humiliated and abused.
In yet another harrowing chapter in the tragic plight of Iraqs Kurdish Yazidi population eyewitnesses have described how girls raped by Muslim fighters from the Islamic State formerly ISIS committed suicide enmasse after returning to their families as evidence of systematic rape by Islamists against nonMuslims continue to surface.
Among the tens of thousands of Yazidi refugees trapped in the Shingal mountains while fleeing ISs deadly advance through Iraqseveral survivors told Kurdish Rudaw TV how a group of three girls were returned after being abducted and raped only to hurl themselves off a cliff after being traumatized by their ordeal.
A Kurdish reporter said the mother of one of the girls had given an interview in front of the camera but claimed Kurdish fighters from the YPG militia had seized the camera and erased the interview possibly in an attempt to avoid sowing panic.
The mother reportedly told of how in their desperation the girls begged other refugees to kill them but when no one would comply they killed themselves.
The YPG is the dominant Kurdish force in Syria and has taken control of some areas across the border in Iraq since IS swept away Iraqi forces earlier in the summer. It has been credited with putting up a stiff resistance against Islamist forces and helping to save many Yazidi and Christian refugees but has also criticized as authoritarian by its opponents.
They IS took the girls by force and raped them and after they returned they killed themselves she said.
Some Kurds say the systematic rape of Yazidi women is yet more evidence of no less than a genocide against their people by IS.
As the Islamic State rampages through northern Iraq witnesses say they have made a point of slaughtering any men who refuse to convert to Islam and taking women and children as slaves. In one incident on Friday Yazidi men were executed and around women and children kidnapped in the tiny Yazidi village of Kojo in northern Iraq.
The Yazidi religion is indigenous to Kurdistan and Yazidis themselves are ethnicallyKurdish. But unlike many other Kurds they largely avoided intermarriage with surrounding Arab tribes and thus a many of them maintained a strikingly fair Aryan complexion with blond hair and blue eyes. By raping their women IS fighters complement the slaughter and forcedconversions of the Yazidis by impregnating them and breaking their bloodline according to one leading Kurdish activist.
The Kurds and Yazidis are originally Aryans.But because the Yazidis are such a closed community they have retained a fairer complexion blonder hair and bluer eyes. They dont marry nonYazidis Adnan Kochar chairman of the Kurdish Cultural Centre in London explained to theDaily Mail.
ISIS have taken around women from Sinjar to give to jihadists to marry and make pregnant to have a Muslim child. If they cant kill all Yazidis they will try to smash the blond bloodline he said.
Last weekthe Special Representative of the UNs SecretaryGeneral on Sexual Violence SRSG in Conflict Zainab Hawa Bangura and the Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral for Iraq Nickolay Mladenov condemned sexual violence being employed by Islamic State terrorists against nonMuslim women and children.
We are gravely concerned by continued reports of acts of violence including sexual violence against women and teenage girls and boys belonging to Iraqi minorities read a jointstatement.
Atrocious accounts of abduction and detention of Yazidi Christian as well as Turkomen and Shabak women girls and boys and reports of savage rapes are reaching us in an alarming manner Ms. Bangura and Mr. Mladenov added saying that some Yazidi and Christian persons may have been forced into sexual slavery. That number is now likely to be much higher as Islamists have since made further gains.
But on Sunday Kurdish Peshmerga forces aided by US airstrikes have reportedly made gains and are advancing on the strategicallyimportant Mosul Dam which was seized by IS on August .
Many Yazidi men have enlisted to Peshmerga forces to help push back the Islamists and reclaim their homeland from ISs selfstyled Caliphate.

A charttopping Indian rapper known for his sexually explicit lyrics has been caught in a backlash against sexism and misogyny after a deadly gang rape that shocked the nation.
Honey Singh whose hits include My Home My Village saw his New Years Eve concert in New Delhi cancelled following an online campaign over lyrics that incite violence against women.
Amid lowkey New Years celebrations following the shocking gang rape on December the upmarket Bristol Hotel in a suburb of New Delhi cancelled the show an employee said.
The popular star who sang in Bollywood films last year and has several top hits told the Hindustan Times he himself had called off the performance to express my grief for the unfortunate girl.
The furore over the rap star comes as the country comes to terms with the incident in which a yearold medical student was repeatedly assaulted and violated with an iron bar while being driven around in a bus for minutes.
Extreme sexual violence and gang rapes are commonplace in India but the case brought simmering anger particularly among young urban women to the boil and led to violent protests in the capital.
Home minister Sushilkumar Shinde said six suspects arrested after the crime risked the death penalty if found guilty and the case against them appeared very strong.
We have a solid case with very good evidence. a magistrate has recorded the victims dying declaration and we have a prime witness the girls friend who has identified the rapists Mr Shinde told The Economic Times newspaper.
The victims boyfriend whom friends said she intended to marry tried to prevent the rape and was likely to give crucial evidence during what was expected to be a fasttracked trial.
Police are to file charges and present their evidence against the suspects five men and a minor on Thursday.
Delhi police have said their probe is almost complete pending the arrival of an autopsy report from doctors in Singapore and the conclusions of forensic experts.

Detectives are investigating reports of students being raped since the start of term.
Shocking figures show the number of reported sex attacks on people studying in the region has doubled since last year.
A total of rapes on students aged between and were reported to police in Greater Manchester in August September and October.
And GMP chiefs have now teamed up with university and Student Union bosses to launch a hardhitting campaign urging young men not to take advantage of drunk girls.
The cases include attacks by strangers such as that on a yearold girl who was dragged into an alleyway and raped in a harrowing attack in Manchesters student heartland Fallowfield late last month.
However police claim that such incidents are rare with most rape victims knowing their attacker in some way.
They say many reported incidents have occurred after drunken liaisons between students on nights out.
A powerful poster which will be put up at university buildings and halls of residences as well as clubs and bars warns students that Drinking is not a crime Rape is.
If shes too drunk too consent then the best thing for all involved is to assume it has not been given.
Rape ruins lives for both the victim and perpetrator and you have my absolute word that we will take each report seriously and are committed to bringing offenders to justice whatever the circumstances may be.
Manchester has a massive nighttime economy and people should be able to go out and let their hair down.
What we are trying to do is get the message out their to potential offenders about consent. If we can reduce offending even by a small amount I will consider that a success.

Bangladesh cricketers Rubel Hossain R acknowledges the crowd as Shakib Al Hasan R looks on as they walk off the field after winning the second cricket Test match between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna.
DHAKA Bangladesh cricketer Rubel Hossain who has been named in the countrys World Cup squad was behind bars Thursday after being remanded in custody over allegations that he raped an actress.
A magistrate in the capital Dhaka delivered the order after yearold Naznin Akter Happy lodged a complaint of rape and a false promise of marriage against the cricketer last month.
The courts decision puts a huge question mark over the yearolds appearance in the next months World Cup in Australia and New Zealand after selectors picked him in the man squad last weekend.
The metropolitan magistrate court rejected his bail plea.He was sent to prison pending the next hearing of the case deputy commissioner of Dhaka police Anisur Rahman told AFP.
Police last month launched a probe after Happy lodged a complaint with police that the fast bowler had backed away from an earlier pledge to marry her after having a monthslong intimate affair.
After hearing the complaint a court ordered medical tests on Happy and both the alleged victim and Hossain to undergo DNA tests.
The scandal has gripped the conservative Muslimmajority country for weeks with Happy telling reporters that she would be prepared to withdraw the case if Rubel agrees to marry her.
Although victims of alleged rapes are usually entitled to anonymity Happys decision to go public prompted police to waive the usual restrictions.
Under Bangladeshi law anyone who makes what is considered a false marriage proposal is liable to criminal prosecution.
The fast bowler has rejected the accusations of rape or making a marriage proposal saying Happy was trying to blackmail him. He also ruled out marrying the actress.
Happy became a household name for her debut movie Kichu Asha Bhalobasa Some Hopes Some Loves which hit the cinemas in September .
After filing the complaint Happy told private Channel that they had a relationship like any other couple but that recently he was finding excuses not to marry me.
Its an act of cheating and I want him to be punished she said without elaborating on the rape allegation.
Rubel has played Tests for Bangladesh and taken wickets. He has also taken wickets in oneday international matches including a hattrick against New Zealand.

The wellbeing of our prisoners isnt a topic that often garners much sympathy. Perhaps that is why few Americans know that rapes and sexual assaults of U.S. inmates have reached epidemic proportions.
In addition to its own editorials USA TODAY publishes a variety of opinions from outside writers. On political and policy matters we publish opinions from across the political spectrum.
Roughly half of our columns come from our Board of Contributors a group whose interests range from education to religion to sports to the economy. Their charge is to chronicle American culture by telling the stories large and small that collectively make us what we are.
We also publish weekly columns by Al Neuharth USA TODAYs founder and DeWayne Wickham who writes primarily on matters of race but on other subjects as well. That leaves plenty of room for other views from across the nation by wellknown and lesserknown names alike.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics confirmed this human rights crisis last month. It says that nearly one in prisoners report having been raped or sexually assaulted by other inmates staff or both.
Thats why the release of a separate report by the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission which was created by Congress in is so important. It challenges our society to take seriously a problem that has ruined many lives.
The website of the health and human rights organization Just Detention International JDI tells some of the inmates troubling stories.
While I was in an Arkansas state prison I was raped by at least different inmates over a ninemonth period said Bryson Martel Spruce a bisexual former inmate. I dont have to tell you that it was the worst nine months of my life.
Spruce contracted HIV as a result of the attacks. Standards are needed to protect people like me he said before he died in .
Spruces story is a disturbing example of the particular challenge lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people face when incarcerated. I knew him well Lovisa Stannow JDIs executive director said of Spruce. He spoke often about how he was targeted because of his sexual orientation.
More than onethird of gay and bisexual male inmates said that they were victimized by another inmate according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics report. By comparison only . of straight male inmates reported being sexually assaulted by other inmates. Bisexual female inmates also were targeted for sexual assaults more than their fellow inmates. 
Of course gender and sexual orientation are not the main issue. No inmate in our prisons should have to endure rapes or sexual assaults whether committed by other inmates or staff.
Bryan Stevenson executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative EJI a private nonprofit organization traces the vulnerability of prisoners to sexual assaults back to three pieces of legislation passed during the Clinton administration. The Prison Litigation and Reform Act made it more difficult for prisoners to sue for abuse of power or dangerous treatment. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act essentially guaranteed that inmates who have suffered wrongful convictions will have a tougher time challenging them. And by making convicts ineligible for food stamps or public housing the infamous Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of better known as welfare reform virtually ensured higher recividism rates. Together these laws have not only robbed more vulnerable inmates of just opportunities to gain and maintain freedom they also have guaranteed that some will be targeted for prison rapes while trapped inside.
All of that I think would have been shocking even to a Republican legislator in the s or early s Stevenson said.
The commissions new prison rape elimination standards blessed by the Justice Department include requirements for adequate prison staffing sexual abuse prevention training for staff creating more ways for inmates to report sexual abuse privately no crossgender searches of female inmates by male staff publishing sexual abuse statistics annually and audits every three years. State prisons that dont comply will lose federal funding.
The new standards will add heft to current complaints such as the one filed by EJI against the Alabama Department of Corrections that is now under investigation by the Justice Department. EJI alleges that inmates of the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka Ala. have suffered widespread sexual abuse by male guards including acts of sexual violence that have culminated in pregnancies.
When the government takes away someones freedom it takes on the responsibility of keeping that person safe Stevenson said.
No state can credibly claim to be committed to law and order if its response to sexual assaults in prison is passive at best. But this is not just about justice for inmates. The commissions report includes the story of Air Force veteran Tom Cahill who was beaten and gangraped by inmates while spending one night in a San Antonio jail.
Ive been hospitalized more times than I can count Cahill told the commission. For the past two decades Ive received a nonservice connected security pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs at the cost of about in connection with the only major trauma Ive ever suffered the rape.
Cahills horrific experience happened in just one night spent in jail. For those spending years in prison their nightmare can be never ending until the new standards are not only implemented but also enforced to protect vulnerable prisoners.
Sure these inmates are paying for their crimes but rape is not part of their sentence.
David Person a member of USA TODAYs Board of Contributors is directing the forthcoming television documentary Not Our Bodies an examination of rape sexual assaults and race.
The sickening revelation came as a young Yazidi rape victim in Iraq claimed her attacker swore that what he was doing to her was not a sin because she practised a nonIslamic religion.
Around women and girls from the religious minority were abducted by the brutal regime last year with the terror group creating a system of sex slavery which included sales contracts that were processed through its infamous court system.
He told me that according to Islam he is allowed to rape an unbeliever. He said that by raping me he is drawing closer to God 
The yearold girl has since escaped to a refugee camp after a harrowing months in captivity.
Another yearold girl who escaped after nine months of slavery under ISIS said that every time her attacker came to rape her he would pray.
The immoral group has made raping Yazidi women and girls a large part of its wicked culture using warehouses to hold its victims having viewing rooms for inspections and moving them around via a fleet of buses.
It has helped ISIS recruit men from conservative Muslim societies which ban causal sex and dating.
Former Islamist Alyas Karmani recently claimed that young British Muslims are joining the abhorrent terror group because they want sex.
The UKbased preacher said that the young Muslims feel isolated in sexualised British society because they lack the same freedoms enjoyed by young Western teenagers.
The Bradford preacher who tours the UK to help stop young Muslims from turning to ISIS claimed that the surge in British Muslims joining ISIS is all about sex.
Last week ISIS fanatics savagely executed women for refusing to have sex with them.
The terror group killed the women hostages because they refused to participate in the practice of sexual jihad according to a Kurdish official.
They were being held captive in the Iraqi city of Mosul which is one of ISISs last major strongholds.
Sorry we are unable to accept comments about this article at the moment. However you will find some great articles
We need antirape campaigns that target young men and boys. Campaigns that teach them from a young age how to respect women and ultimately themselves and to never ever be rapists. In addition we should implore our men and boys to call out their friends relatives and classmates for inappropriate behavior and create systems of accountability amongst them.
There area number of men who do not understand what constitutes rape which is a consequence of the stranger in the alley falsehood presented in movies and popular culture. You dont need a mask and a gun to sexually violate a woman. The truth is that rape can happen with a woman you are dating whom youve had sex with previously in a monogamous relationship and even in marriage. If one party withdraws consent at any time then its rape. Consent can be withdrawn by the words no or stop and in many states a woman doesnt have to say no at all. Consumption of alcohol can prevent a woman from being able to legally offer consent. Therefore it is important for men and women alike to be very clear about their intentions and prioritize consent over the excitement of getting some.
Our community much like societyatlarge needs a paradigm shift as it relates to our sexual assault prevention efforts. For so long all of our energy has been directed at women teaching them to be more ladylike and to not be promiscuous to not drink too much or to not wear a skirt.
How about we teach young men when a woman says stop they stop How about we teach young men that when a woman has too much to drink that they should not have sex with her if for no other reason but to protect themselves from being accused of a crime How about we teach young men that when they see their friends doing something inappropriate to intervene or to stop being friends The culture that allows men to violate women will continue to flourish so long as there is no great social consequence for men who do so. And while many men punished for sexual assaults each year countless others are able to commit rape and other crimes against women because we so often blame the victim instead of the guilty party.
Holding women and girls accountable for preventing sexual assault hasnt worked and so long as men commit the majority of rapes men need to be at the heart of our tactics for preventing them. Lets stop teaching how to avoid being a victim and instead attack the culture that creates predators in the first place.

The sick ruling was ordered by an unelected allmale council in a remote village in the Baghpat district of northern India just outside Delhi.
The girls aged and have been forced to leave their home with the remainder of their family according to Amnesty International.
News outlets in the country have revealed that the sisters brother Ravi fell in love with a woman from the Jat caste a higher caste than him and his family who are Dalit the lowest in Indias caste system and are referred to as untouchable.
On July the village council deemed the appropriate punishment for Ravi running away with a married woman from a higher caste was for his sisters to be raped.
Amnesty International have launched a petition appealing for Indias authorities to intervene.
More often than not they are made up of older men from dominant castes who prescribe rules for social behaviour and interaction in villages.
Nothing could justify this abhorrent punishment. Its not fair. Its not right. And its against the law.
Zerlina Maxwell offers ways to prevent rape without making women responsible for the crimes committed against them 
I think that the entire conversation is wrong. I dont want anybody to be telling women anything. I dont want men to be telling me what to wear and how to act not to drink. And I dont honestly want you to tell me that I needed a gun in order to prevent my rape. In my case dont tell me if Id only had a gun I wouldnt have been raped. Dont put it on me to prevent the rape.
When I said that We can prevent rape by telling men not to commit it I wasnt expressing some simplistic fantastical worldview. There are organizationslike Men Can Stop Rape and Men Stopping Violencethat are already doing the work to train men from a young age to understand and challenge rape culture. Interestingly enough many who disagreed with my argument chose to send me rape threats insults and dismissive remarksthat in many ways proved my point.
Jaclyn Friedman author of Yes Means Yes coined the term enthusiastic consent which flips the traditional lens with which we view consent on its head. She asks What if instead of just the absence of no an enthusiastic yes was required as a standard for sexual consent
We need to focus on the messages that men are getting and about how they relate to women. We also need to focus on what messaging men are getting about women and about what kind of women get raped.
The really important thing about consent education its not that rapists dont know they dont have consent its that everyone else is vague about it in their own lives Friedman tells EBONY.
Consent is actually easy to figure out. You have to ask. Its your job to ask. Its not gendered. Women also have the responsibility to ask. And if you cant tell ask.
By not being clear that the concept of legal consent is simple and not a vague gray area we are removing all of the excuses and allowing rapists to get away with it with impunity. We assume guys dont understand what consent is and that they dont understand what they are doing and then we let them off the hook. They likely know they dont have consent even though they may not identify what they are doing is rape. The men and boys in your life should want for their partner to be not merely submissive but excited at the idea of having sex. Let them knowyou dont want a girl to give it up you want a mutually enjoyable experience that both parties went into willingly.
There is no shortage of evidence that rape culture results from the objectification of women and the view that we exist simply for male pleasure. When a ESPN football commentator implies that the reward for being a star quarterback is that you get to have a pretty girlfriend that takes away a womans individual agency. She is simply an object to be possessed. An object there for male desire and nothing more.
The young men in Steubenville arent monsters. They did something monstrous and criminal but perhaps we should begin to stop repeating the notion that criminals are the ones raping in women. No its our husbands boyfriends acquaintances relatives and friends and they rape because they are not taught to see women as full autonomous human

If you are a woman and you use socialnetworking site Moco Space you may want to slow your roll. In less than four months three women have been raped after chatting on the website and then meeting up with their new acquaintances according to MyFoxDetroit.
On Mettetal St. two women met up with men they met on Moco Space months apart only to have a weapon pulled on them and then be sexually assaulted.
Individuals are meeting people on a social networking site they should meet someplace thats more of a public forum maybe the mall maybe a restaurant something like that where there are going to be a lot of people. To meet at a house and you just met over the internet to me is a lot dangerous obviously for these young ladies said Keith Lenton.
Sheriffs detectives said Jose Adrian Cano met the yearold girl online through the website Mocospace which is also a popular phone application. During a press conference Wednesday detectives said the two corresponded for about a month. Det. Pete Carrillo said Cano allegedly picked the girl up from school had sex with her and dropped her off last Friday.
Cano was reportedly arrested while he was on his way to meet yet another girl he met on the website.
Detroit authorities are asking anyone who has been assaulted to to call the Detroit Police Sex Crimes unit at or Crime Stoppers of Michigan at SPEAKUP . Anonymous tips can also be given online at www.speakup.org or via text at .

The commonlaw crime of rape involved a man having carnal knowledge of a woman not his wife through force and against her will and required at least slight penetration of the penis into the vagina. While some states maintain essentially this definition of rape most have broadened its scope especially in terms of the sex of the persons and the nature of the acts involved. Marital status is usually irrelevant. Moreover the crime is codified under various names including first degree sexual assault sexual battery unlawful sexual intercourse and first degree sexual abuse.

A McKinney rapist already serving years in prison pleaded guilty Wednesday to a fourth charge of sexual assault involving a fourth woman.
Roger Allen Stulce Jr. described by a prosecutor last year as a dangerous man who preyed on women and gave them nightmares was sentenced to years in prison in this most recent case. The sentence is to run at the same time as the first year sentence Stulce received in December.
In this most recent case the woman connected with Stulce through a free online dating site called Plenty of Fish. In December they met for the first time and went out to dinner at a McKinney restaurant. Afterward they rented movies and went back to Stulces apartment where he forced the woman to have sex twice.
In December Stulce was convicted of sexually assaulting a woman who responded to his Craigslist ad to sublease an apartment. He was sentenced to the maximum years in prison.
In April he was convicted after a second trialof sexually assaulting a woman in July at the apartment complex where they both lived. He invited her out to have drinks and play pool. They returned to her apartment where he raped her after she fell asleep. Again he received the maximum year sentence but the judge ordered the sentence to start only after the sentence in the first case concluded.
In August Stulce was convicted in the sexual assault of a third woman. Testimony showed Stulce forced the womanto engage in sexual acts without her consent on at least four separate occasions including a sexual assault in in McKinney. He attempted to assault the woman again in while she was living in California testimony showed. The year sentence in this case was also stacked so that Stulce must serve the first two year sentences before he begins serving this sentence.
The women arenot being identified becauseThe Dallas Morning Newsgenerally does not name the victims of sex crimes.
A woman and a preteen girl were sexually assaulted by strangers in separate attacks Tuesday and Wednesday near the Interstate corridor Dallas police said.
The young girl was approached by a stranger around p.m. Tuesdayand was raped on the street in a residential area somewhere along Philip Avenue in Old East Dallas police said.
And shortly after midnight Wednesday a man reportedly punched a woman then sexually assaulted her on a sidewalk on Bluebell Street a small road near railroad tracks off of South Cesar Chavez Boulevard in South Dallas. Police said the victim believes she knew of the man but didnt have a personal relationship with him.
Police did not provide detailed descriptions of either man. No arrests have been made.
Federal immigration agents walked Oghenero Peter Toritseju Aluya to Terminal E at the DallasFort Worth International Airport with a oneway ticket to Nigeria.
It was April the day of his scheduled removal from the U.S. as a result of a judges order.
Aluya refused to board the plane and instead tried to drop to the ground and began shouting that he was not going back to Nigeria according to a federal complaint filed this week.
He is now charged in federal court in Dallas with failing to comply with a removal order.
Aluya arrived in Dallas in January with a valid Nigerian passport and a student visa to attend Cameron University in Lawton Okla according to the complaint.
Seven months later Lawton police arrested him on a firstdegree rape charge. He later pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and battery and received a year deferred sentence with the requirement that he serve the first days behind bars.
As a result of that felony conviction Aluyas student visa was terminated and he ended up in federal immigration court. In September a federal immigration judge ordered him removed from the country.
In April U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents escorted Aluya to the airport terminal to place him on a Delta Airlines flight to Nigeria.
Aluya shook his head from left to right and stated that he would not go back to Nigeria the complaint said. Aluya proceeded to drop his weight towards the ground and began yelling at the top of his voice that he was not going back to Nigeria.
Monika Korra competes in the meter steeplechase during the UTA Bobby Lane Invitational at UTArlington Maverick Stadium on April . Vernon BryantDallas Morning News
It hasnt. The former SMU runner a native of Norway was a victim of rape in December when she wasabductedand raped at gunpoint in Old East Dallas by three men. The attackers were prosecuted and received life sentences in and .
We cant escape pain and tragedy Korra said to an audience of hundreds at the Sheraton Hotel downtown. There are about law enforcement officers prosecutors and advocates attending the th annual Conference on Crimes Against Women. What matters is what we do with the experiences that are placed in our path.
The athlete introduced her story and told the conference attendees she was honored to speak to people who save lives like mine.
In her speech Korra described how before her incident she had always thought about rape and abuse as something that happened to other people or something she read about in the news.
This happens in the world we live in she said looking back. This happened to me. About women are raped in the United States every day.
Despite battling the physical pain and mental anguish of the incident Korra says she is healed. She used her lifes work running to strengthen her body and mind.
I will never regret following my dream and moving to Dallas to run Korra said. I faced evil but I stared it down.
Korra has established the Monika Korra Foundation which aims to help victims of rape by encouraging them to free themselves from blaming themselves and raise awareness about these crimes.

We hope that these arrests will give the victim some closure and she will be able to start thehealing process police said in a statement.
I was greetedTuesday morningwith a voicemail from a reader who took issue with something I wrote in a list of safety tips accompanying my Monday story about rape survivor Ashley Green.
The reader said he disagreed. He thinks Green and the two friends who left the bar with her on the night she was attacked in June of last year all deserve blame for what happened. The two friends hopped in a cab and Green walked a short distance toward her car. But she never made it.
I think they all three share a whole lot of blame he said. Why in the world were they all three left at the same time did they not get in the cab together and the cab driver drive her the short two blocks to her car
Im highlighting this mans voicemail message because unfortunately his point of view was all too common in this case just as such views are not uncommon in response to thousands of other rapes. Perhaps thats part of why rape remains one of the most under reported crimes with percent not reported according to RAINN.
If the question is whether you should always try to avoid walking alone to your car at night in a major American city then the answer is obviously yes. We should always try to walk in groups.
But is a violation of that basic safety guideline an invitation for someone to beat rob and rape the woman who walked alone to her car
And therein lies the problem with the logic of my caller and so many others who expressed similar sentiments in the days after Green was attacked last year. Green and her friends were among those who heard the comments or read them online.
It really hurt me Green told me in an interview earlier this month. People making comments to the point that I could have avoided this if I wasnt so stupid as to be walking alone.
The yearold former Parkland Memorial Hospital trauma nurse also understands the broader implications.
So many people put blame on victims and say you know what they could have done and almost like they were asking for it Green said. But you dont really see people saying Well why the hell is there this awful person out there doing this stuff Like why dont we put the blame on these bad people so to speak Just because I happened to be walking to my car and not a long distance alone isnt an open invitation for somebody to come attack me and rape me and murder me or try to murder me.
Veteran Dallas police sex assaults Sgt. Patrick Welsh knows about the victim blame game too. Hes heard the whispers in this case just like so many thousands of other cases he has supervised during his career.
The victim in these kinds of cases is not to be blamed Welsh said in an interview for my story. Its never their fault regardless if theyre walking by themselves in the middle of the night or the middle of the day it is not their fault that they were attaked and brutalized like that.
Its the rapists fault not the victims that this incident occurred Welsh said.
My guess is that many of the folks who directed such criticisms at Green were doing so to make themselves feel better. No one wants to imagine that they could fall victim to an attack as violent as brutal as purely evil as what Green suffered that night last year.
I suspect many of the critics were out in Dallas that same night celebrating the Mavericks championship win over drinks with friends just like Green. I was. Almost of all of us made it home safely whether we walked drove or took a cab alone or with a group of friends at midnight a.m. or noon the next day.
But over in Old East Dallas near the corner of North Henderson and Capitol avenues there was a monster waiting for the right opportunity to attack. Green just happened to be the one he picked.
Her attacker may have been trying to kill her. And he certainly could neverhaveimagined that she would not only survive but also emerge so courageously in an effort to catch him.
Those who blame victims and perpetuate the dangerous stigma that often surrounds sexual crimes may not realize that the victims hear them. Green heard them and now shes responding.
Theres no shame in what happened to me Green said. I didnt do this somebody else did this. Theyre the ones that should be ashamed and living in guilt not me.

Roger Allen Stulce Jr. described by a prosecutor last year as a dangerous man who preyed on women and gave them nightmares was sentenced to years in prison in this most recent case. The sentence is to run at the same time as the first year sentence Stulce received in December.
In this most recent case the woman connected with Stulce through a free online dating site called Plenty of Fish. In December they met for the first time and went out to dinner at a McKinney restaurant. Afterward they rented movies and went back to Stulces apartment where he forced the woman to have sex twice.
In December Stulce was convicted of sexually assaulting a woman who responded to his Craigslist ad to sublease an apartment. He was sentenced to the maximum years in prison.
In April he was convicted after a second trialof sexually assaulting a woman in July at the apartment complex where they both lived. He invited her out to have drinks and play pool. They returned to her apartment where he raped her after she fell asleep. Again he received the maximum year sentence but the judge ordered the sentence to start only after the sentence in the first case concluded.
In August Stulce was convicted in the sexual assault of a third woman. Testimony showed Stulce forced the womanto engage in sexual acts without her consent on at least four separate occasions including a sexual assault in in McKinney. He attempted to assault the woman again in while she was living in California testimony showed. The year sentence in this case was also stacked so that Stulce must serve the first two year sentences before he begins serving this sentence.
The women arenot being identified becauseThe Dallas Morning Newsgenerally does not name the victims of sex crimes.
A woman and a preteen girl were sexually assaulted by strangers in separate attacks Tuesday and Wednesday near the Interstate corridor Dallas police said.
The young girl was approached by a stranger around p.m. Tuesdayand was raped on the street in a residential area somewhere along Philip Avenue in Old East Dallas police said.
And shortly after midnight Wednesday a man reportedly punched a woman then sexually assaulted her on a sidewalk on Bluebell Street a small road near railroad tracks off of South Cesar Chavez Boulevard in South Dallas. Police said the victim believes she knew of the man but didnt have a personal relationship with him.
Police did not provide detailed descriptions of either man. No arrests have been made.
Federal immigration agents walked Oghenero Peter Toritseju Aluya to Terminal E at the DallasFort Worth International Airport with a oneway ticket to Nigeria.
It was April the day of his scheduled removal from the U.S. as a result of a judges order.
Aluya refused to board the plane and instead tried to drop to the ground and began shouting that he was not going back to Nigeria according to a federal complaint filed this week.
He is now charged in federal court in Dallas with failing to comply with a removal order.
Aluya arrived in Dallas in January with a valid Nigerian passport and a student visa to attend Cameron University in Lawton Okla according to the complaint.
Seven months later Lawton police arrested him on a firstdegree rape charge. He later pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and battery and received a year deferred sentence with the requirement that he serve the first days behind bars.
As a result of that felony conviction Aluyas student visa was terminated and he ended up in federal immigration court. In September a federal immigration judge ordered him removed from the country.
In April U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents escorted Aluya to the airport terminal to place him on a Delta Airlines flight to Nigeria.
Aluya shook his head from left to right and stated that he would not go back to Nigeria the complaint said. Aluya proceeded to drop his weight towards the ground and began yelling at the top of his voice that he was not going back to Nigeria.

It hasnt. The former SMU runner a native of Norway was a victim of rape in December when she wasabductedand raped at gunpoint in Old East Dallas by three men. The attackers were prosecuted and received life sentences in and .
We cant escape pain and tragedy Korra said to an audience of hundreds at the Sheraton Hotel downtown. There are about law enforcement officers prosecutors and advocates attending the th annual Conference on Crimes Against Women. What matters is what we do with the experiences that are placed in our path.
The athlete introduced her story and told the conference attendees she was honored to speak to people who save lives like mine.
In her speech Korra described how before her incident she had always thought about rape and abuse as something that happened to other people or something she read about in the news.
This happens in the world we live in she said looking back. This happened to me. About women are raped in the United States every day.
Despite battling the physical pain and mental anguish of the incident Korra says she is healed. She used her lifes work running to strengthen her body and mind.
I will never regret following my dream and moving to Dallas to run Korra said. I faced evil but I stared it down.
Korra has established the Monika Korra Foundation which aims to help victims of rape by encouraging them to free themselves from blaming themselves and raise awareness about these crimes.

Ferrious Cannon left and Ronnie Higgs are being held in the Dallas County Jail.
Grand Prairie police arrested two teens last week who police say beat raped and robbed a pizza delivery driver in July.
When she arrived at the house according to policeshe saw a man on the porch of the vacant home and then was approached by another man from behind. The man who approached her from behind hit her with a pistol and knocked her down according to police.
The teens identified as Ferrious Cannon and Ronnie Higgs held the woman at gunpoint robbed her and forced sexually assaulter her. The injured woman then drove herself back to work and called .
She was transported to Parkland Memorial Hospital and treated there. Her condition today is unknown.
The two suspects were identified soon after. Higgs was arrested Aug. and charged with aggravated robbery. His bail is set at . Cannon was arrested Aug. and charged with aggravated sexual assault and aggravated robbery.
We hope that these arrests will give the victim some closure and she will be able to start thehealing process police said in a statement.
I was greetedTuesday morningwith a voicemail from a reader who took issue with something I wrote in a list of safety tips accompanying my Monday story about rape survivor Ashley Green.
The reader said he disagreed. He thinks Green and the two friends who left the bar with her on the night she was attacked in June of last year all deserve blame for what happened. The two friends hopped in a cab and Green walked a short distance toward her car. But she never made it.
I think they all three share a whole lot of blame he said. Why in the world were they all three left at the same time did they not get in the cab together and the cab driver drive her the short two blocks to her car
Im highlighting this mans voicemail message because unfortunately his point of view was all too common in this case just as such views are not uncommon in response to thousands of other rapes. Perhaps thats part of why rape remains one of the most under reported crimes with percent not reported according to RAINN.
If the question is whether you should always try to avoid walking alone to your car at night in a major American city then the answer is obviously yes. We should always try to walk in groups.
But is a violation of that basic safety guideline an invitation for someone to beat rob and rape the woman who walked alone to her car
And therein lies the problem with the logic of my caller and so many others who expressed similar sentiments in the days after Green was attacked last year. Green and her friends were among those who heard the comments or read them online.
It really hurt me Green told me in an interview earlier this month. People making comments to the point that I could have avoided this if I wasnt so stupid as to be walking alone.
The yearold former Parkland Memorial Hospital trauma nurse also understands the broader implications.
So many people put blame on victims and say you know what they could have done and almost like they were asking for it Green said. But you dont really see people saying Well why the hell is there this awful person out there doing this stuff Like why dont we put the blame on these bad people so to speak Just because I happened to be walking to my car and not a long distance alone isnt an open invitation for somebody to come attack me and rape me and murder me or try to murder me.
Veteran Dallas police sex assaults Sgt. Patrick Welsh knows about the victim blame game too. Hes heard the whispers in this case just like so many thousands of other cases he has supervised during his career.
The victim in these kinds of cases is not to be blamed Welsh said in an interview for my story. Its never their fault regardless if theyre walking by themselves in the middle of the night or the middle of the day it is not their fault that they were attaked and brutalized like that.
Its the rapists fault not the victims that this incident occurred Welsh said.
My guess is that many of the folks who directed such criticisms at Green were doing so to make themselves feel better. No one wants to imagine that they could fall victim to an attack as violent as brutal as purely evil as what Green suffered that night last year.
I suspect many of the critics were out in Dallas that same night celebrating the Mavericks championship win over drinks with friends just like Green. I was. Almost of all of us made it home safely whether we walked drove or took a cab alone or with a group of friends at midnight a.m. or noon the next day.
But over in Old East Dallas near the corner of North Henderson and Capitol avenues there was a monster waiting for the right opportunity to attack. Green just happened to be the one he picked.
Her attacker may have been trying to kill her. And he certainly could neverhaveimagined that she would not only survive but also emerge so courageously in an effort to catch him.
Those who blame victims and perpetuate the dangerous stigma that often surrounds sexual crimes may not realize that the victims hear them. Green heard them and now shes responding.
Theres no shame in what happened to me Green said. I didnt do this somebody else did this. Theyre the ones that should be ashamed and living in guilt not me.

Minutes correspondent Lara Logan was repeatedly sexually assaulted by thugs yelling Jew Jew as she covered the chaotic fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairos main square Friday CBS and sources said yesterday.
This horrible story gets worse and worse. Worse still CBS tried to keep the whole thing quiet and was forced to get in front of the story only when it became widely known that other media outlets were on to it. Who are they covering for
And why Because the false narrative the media is painting of what is going on in Egypt is patently false and this brutal sex attack points to something else entirely.
The NY Post is the only news outlet reporting that the Muslims raping her were shouting Jew Jew Jew. Obama should make a statement addressing this horror and condemning the vile Islamic antisemitism at the heart of Islam.
Minutes correspondent Lara Logan was repeatedly sexually assaulted by thugs yelling Jew Jew as she covered the chaotic fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairos main square Friday CBS and sources said yesterday.
The TV crew with Logan who is also the networks chief foreign correspondent had its cameras rolling moments before she was dragged off and caught her on tape looking tense and trying to head away from a crowd of men behind her in Tahrir Square.
Logan was covering the jubilation . . . when she and her team and their security were surrounded by a dangerous element amidst the celebration CBS said in a statement. It was a mob of more than people whipped into a frenzy.
In the crush of the mob Logan was separated from her crew. She was surrounded and suffered a brutal and sustained sexual assault and beating before being saved by a group of women and an estimated Egyptian soldiers.
She reconnected with the CBS team returned to her hotel and returned to the United States on the first flight the next morning the network added. She is currently in the hospital recovering.
A network source told The Post that her attackers were screaming Jew Jew during the assault. And the day before Logan had told Esquire.com that Egyptian soldiers hassling her and her crew had accused them of being Israeli spies. Logan is not Jewish.
In Fridays attack she was separated from her colleagues and attacked for between to minutes The Wall Street Journal said.
CBS went public with the incident only after it became clear that other media outlets were on to it sources said.
A call came in from The Associated Press seeking information a TVindustry source told The Post. They knew she had been attacked and they had details. CBS decided to get in front of the story.
Most network higherups didnt even know how brutal the sexual assault was until a few minutes before the statement went out.
Another source insisted that Logan was involved in the process of deciding whether to make her attack public and ultimately understood why the statement had to be released.
The horrific incident came a week after the yearold reporter was temporarily detained by Egyptian police amid tensions over foreign coverage of the countrys growing revolution.
As part of the antimedia backlash CNNs Anderson Cooper had also been roughed up and ABC correspondent Brian Hartman had been threatened with beheading.
Logan was not in the country for long shed been thrown out if you remember and had just gone back in one source said.
Before the attack Logan who is based in Washington where she lives with her yearold daughter and husband had been set to return to the States sometime over the weekend to tape a Minutes segment on Wael Ghonim.
Ghonim Googles head of marketing in the Middle East had been briefly kidnapped after helping to organize protesters.
But after she was assaulted Logan went back to her hotel and within two hours sometime late Friday and into early Saturday was flown out of Cairo on a chartered network jet sources said.
She wasnt taken to a hospital in Egypt because the network didnt trust local security there sources said.
And neither CBS nor Logan reported the crime to Egyptian authorities because they felt they couldnt trust them either the sources said. The way things are there now they would have ended up arresting her again one source said.
Just days before the brave journalist discussed her previous detention in the country on Charlie Rose in an eerie interview she discusses the terror of being in the country and pain she put her family through but vowed she would return because covering the story was in her blood.
The CBS war correspondent who is back home with her kids and recovering after being brutally attacked last week in Egypt has vowed to return to work within weeks.
Logan has been candidly discussing what happened to her last Friday in Tahir Square after a mob attacked her in the hours after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak resigned following weeks of political unrest.
Stay on top of whats really happening. Follow me on Twitter here. Like me on Facebook here.
As you have said again and again You can ignore reality but you can not ignore the consequences of reality.
The only chilling premonitions video Interview given by Lara Logan by Charlie Rose just before she returns to Cairo.
Welcome to the World of Islam and How It Treats Women and in the broader sense How Islam Treats Anything NonMuslim.Cant wait to hear your first report after your recovery when you as a dyedinthewool liberal call for understanding of your Muslim rapists and how its all the fault of the West and Bush.Certainly unfortunate for you Lara but whats it going to take for Americans to learn the true nature of Islam. This Logan event is a micro event. was a huge macro event and still Americans do not believe that Islam is inherently evil. I fear that more events or events are going to be needed to teach the West that Islam is wholly incompatible with civilized society.Certainly unfortunate for the lady involved but what is it going to take for Americans to learn what the true nature of Islam. This Logan event is a micro event. was a huge macro event and still Americans do not believe that Islam is inherently evil. I fear that more events or events are going to be needed to teach the West that Islam is wholly incompatible with civilized society.
It should be noted that she was viewed as uncovered meat so she bears most of the responsiblility.
I guess I do not know if Logan was on to the evil that hides in the happy face that the elitists paint on Islam. But reading her background it seems like she would. Logan is a tough smart courageous woman. Neither the spineless quisling media she works for nor the subhuman cretins she was reporting on deserve to stand in her shadow.Sadly the vast majority of Americans fooled by the deception of our liberal press will never put and together here.Her bosses should have had armed gaurds with her but they probably thought it was rainbows and unicorns too.
Trying to prove their masculinityin vain Just like their prophet who used to complain to his allah about his sexual impotence.
Some of the comments regarding the attack on Lara Logan here and other sites I am finding quite insensitive and reprehensible no matter what your political affiliation is.Yes of course we recognize how women are treated in Islamic countries but to treat this as some kind of teachable moment for Lara Logan is disgusting.
rainbows and unicorns THE LIBERAL OBOWMAO MANTRA.weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I hope she recovers because her body may heal but the terror of her rape may stay with her forever.
yes. I suggest we focus our anger and resolve on the root cause of this which in this case is festers in its own nest the deceptive leftist media.
Arrested kidnapped and tortured by the Egyptian army accused by them of being Israeli spies then seperated from her bodyguards and raped by a crowd yelling Jew How did the crowd know she was a Jew Come on people connect the dots. It was Egyptian soldiers in civilian clothes raping her. Of course a muslim president wont condemn this and risk bad PR for a muslin country.
Leftwing journalist Nir Rosen joked today about the sexual assault of CBS News chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan. Logan was assaulted on Friday during celebrations in Cairo that followed Hosni Mubaraks resignation.The initial tweet by Rosen stated Lara Logan had to outdo Anderson. Where was her buddy McCrystal. From this tweet he went further writing that he would have been amused if Anderson Cooper had also been sexually assaulted.Yes yes its wrong what happened to her. Of course. I dont support that. But it would have been funny if it happened to Anderson too wrote Rosen.
Id chip in to buy slimeball Nir Rosen a ticket to Tahrir Square and a Magen David to wear.
This is terrible. Thank you for reporting. Assuming Ms. Logan wants to go public with the story there is no reason to keep it secret. AntiSemitism is certainly a problem in Cairo and throughout much of the Middle East however I would caution against making blanket accusations vile Islamic antisemitism at the heart of Islam and blaming a whole religion for the horrendous violent actions of a few. Islamophobia is not the way to answer antiSemitism. Keep in mind that it was another group of Cairenes who came to Ms. Logans rescue.
Islam is a peaceful religion. These were just a few zealots just a small minority perverting Islam who attacked her. Come on. Islam is love. You saw the article it was just a couple of hundred men who got whipped into a frenzy by the mob. It wasnt their fault. Islam is love. Obama tells us so.
woman as a war correspondent i think its stupid idea this may be a common ending of sutch stupidity
The premeditated rape and brutalization of Ms. Logan as manifested by these Muslim bastards was pure terrorism endorsed and sanctioned by Islamic core teachings and doctrine. It was not just an isolated attack on Ms. Logan it was a terrorist attack intended to send and instill a message of fear to all Kafir women in order to demonstrate Islamic control dominance and total subjugation. Muhammads favorite sex slave was a white woman and since Muslim men choose to emulate Muhammad in his words and deeds Ms. Logan was unfortunately in their twisted and sick way of thinking the logical target of opportunity. Im sure these sick bastards are still slapping each other on the back and congratulating each other for a job well done. Muslims by their very ideological nature are emotionally and mentally sick people who have chosen to believe in a perverse and psychologically bankrupt totalitarian ideology of hatred racism bigotry terrorism rape brutality slavery domination subjugation and eventually the murder of all Kafirs who are unwilling to either convert or submit under the dhimmi status. Islam is not a legitimate religion as the rest of us know it rather it is a cult of personality based on the false prophet Muhammed and his fabricated tribal moon god allah. My deepest sympathy and prayers go out to Ms. Logan and her family. As to the Muslim bastards who did this to her they should be hunted down like the criminals that they areplain and simple.
They came to her rescue after a half an hour of being publically gangraped while shouting Jew Jew Jew.
Thats like saying Christianity is an evil religion because of the Crusades or because of Westboro Baptist or because the horrors in Abu Ghraib were perpetrated by or given orders from people who were probably Christian. I can say probably here because you dont know the people who assaulted her were Muslim any more than we know those responsible for Abu Ghraib were ChristianLets also not forget that she was saved by a group of women and soldiers who were probably Muslim. Come on. You cant ignore that while still saying those who assaulted her were Muslim.
They must want this journalist to report on this domination and supremacism and abuse to forward the jihad.
Absolutely horrible. Anybody that claims she deserves it because of her political beleifs should be ashamed of themselves. I pray shell recover fine.
Obama wont speak up in support of the People of Iran spontaniously demonstrating against a fanatical Islamic totalitarian government that requires school children to yell Death to America every morning.Yet calls on an ALLIED government in Egypt to step down in favor of the Moslem Brotherhood the souce of all Arab terrorist organizations including alQaida that the US itself is fighting in Afghanistan and NY. And the State Dept. and its media propagandist agents try to fool us into thinking the M.B. is SECULAR wanting democracy yet The powerful Moslem Brotherhood wants to replace Mubaraks government with Sharia Law. It wants democracy for DAY in order to be voted in for life. Then Godhelp anyone who questions the will of the people and Allahs choosen.And the US media says this is a spontaneous revolt of the downtrodden Egyptian people who only want democracy and an end to human rights abuses. Yet it wants to hide from YOU that one of its own was GANGRaped in public by the People in front of the People for half an hour by secular democratic humanrights rapists shouting Jew Jew Jew all during the rape.The reports I got from MSM were that journalists only felt threatened or were roughed up. RAPE is not roughed up. Humanrights adorers dont gangrape. Secular folks dont shout Jew Jew Jew or want Sharia Law or belong to the Moslem Brotherhood Terror OrganizationRight Atlas who what ARE the media covering for Whowhat is Obama working for Why are we buying it
If we cannot judge how is it possible to distinguish good from evil right from wrongMulticulturalists and moral relativists assert that all cultures societies and religions are equal i.e. none morally superior or morally inferior than others.If they truly believe this then it is impossible to blame the gang rapists for their acts as it is indeed part of their religion as referenced by the Koran confirmed by the Hadiths and considered acceptablecommendable as the Islamic prophet Mohammed did the exact same things.We can no more blame the attackers for their acts due to cultural or societal influences or religions than we can condemn them based on the color of the socks they wore that day.The problem with modern PC multiculturalism is they fail to consider that there IS black and white right and wrong.It is therefore only reasonable and logical to conclude that indeed some cultures societies and religions are morally superior to others while others are morally inferior to others.Multiculturalism that promotes and tolerates evil and moral relativism should be considered illnesses.
Have you seen how insensitive the LEFT are to her check out the Liberals comments on the Youtube page below for the video in this article. These are the same people that tell us we need to give more in taxes to be compassionate to the poor. But the poor is an abstract that doesnt have a face to real people. The Left has NO compassion for actual people only for abstract ideas.
This cry relates to an event in the seventh century when Muslims massacred and expelled the Jews from the town of Khaybar in modernday Saudi Arabia.And this is by no means confined to an extremist fringe. The Koranic impulse toward antiSemitism is evident in the attacks on Jews emanating from Islamic preachers and scholars worldwide. Take for example Jews as Depicted in the Quran an article posted in on the website Islam Online. The websites founders include the prominent Islamic theologian Sheikh Yusuf alQaradawi who is hailed as a moderate reformist by Western Islamic apologistsThe article written by Sheikh Atiyyah Saqr formerly of AlAzhar University copiously cites the Koran in depicting the Jews as a gang of corrupt deceitful cutthroats.Saqr concludes on an optimistic note voicing hopes that some day Muslims will be able to mete out punishment to their enemies Almighty Allah told us that Hed send to them people whod pour on them rain of severe punishment that would last till the Day of Resurrection. All this gives us glad tidings of the coming victory of Muslims over them once Muslims stick to strong faith and belief in Allah and adopt the modern means of technology.One should consider Saqrs interpretation in light of Irans feverish attempts to acquire a nuclear bomb alongside the repeated vows by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to wipe Israel off the map. For Ahmadinejad and his ilk eliminating the Jewish state is not just a foreign policy goal it is a religious imperative.In March Sheikh Ibrahim Mudayris speaking on official Palestinian Authority television railed against the Jews today taking revenge for their grandfathers and ancestors the sons of apes and pigs.Saqr for his part asserted that because Jews revolted against the Divine ordinances they found no warm reception in all countries where they tried to reside. Rather they would either be driven out or live in isolation. Moreover Almighty Allah told us that Hed send to them people whod pour on them rain of severe punishment that would last till the Day of Resurrection.Those people would be by Saqrs own account and that of other Islamic clerics the Muslims.Harry de Quetteville Christians still swine and Jews apes in Saudi schools Telegraph June .Alexandra Frean Teacher accuses Islamic school of racism The Times April .Atiyyah Saqr Jews as Depicted in the Quran Islam Online March .
And why Because the false narrative the media is painting of what is going on in Egypt is patently false and this brutal sex attack points to something else entirely.Which begs the question why do these MSM outlets which have absolutely no interest in reporting what is really going on send their correspondents to Egypt in the first place It is obviously not to find out whats going on because they are whitewashing what is going on. If youre going to be a pretend news outlet and lie about whats going on then why bother sending someone into a danger zone You can lie just as well from New York as you can from Cairo. It must be to give some pretend credibility to your lies. So basically CBS sent this woman into an incredibly dangerous situation to give credibility to their lies.
Thanks for that posting for being informative and giving perspective to a prejudice which runs through Arab lands even more intensely than it does elsewhere.However this was a mob scene which is taken over by mob emotions which are not based in whatever people scream that is just the nearest channel in their crazed brains.
According to a Wall Street Journal source Logan who is mother to two young children was not raped.According to different media sources CBS Senior Reporter Lara Logan will be released from a hospital today.
My guess is CBS was more interested in protecting the party line than the privacy of Lara Logan. I wish her well.
It is an adjective to denounce someone deserving the most profound hatred and punishment.Kinda like saying Fing bitchwhore and alike. As when using that term one doesnt mean the person in question is a prostitute.
Well what can I say every revolution is also a rebellion and mobs anarchy and total chaos are the very essence of it. Deepest condolences to the lady. However if Americans are so happy to see dictators thrown out in such fashion and if they are indeed eager to give a helping hand in such overthrows they need to learn to live with the consequences. Generally speaking revolutionary mobs also happen to be staunch nationalists thats almost like a hard and fast rule. Even Americans tarandfeathered loyalists at that time. So in fact I always thought that Americans should be happy with dictators. Democratic mobs especially in those problematic regions of the world have very few reasons to like Americans.
Islam oppresses women and nonmuslims. Wake up you idiot voice of delusion. Did you not see the brave Iranian women throwing off their head coverings and burial shrouds burquain their protests We know the evil of this religion by observing their treatment of women.
Correct. She was raped bcuz she was in western garb not shrouded head to toe in slave cloth.
The Crusades would have never taken place if Christian Europe had burned down Mecca after Muslim Arabs sailed up the Tiber and attacked the Vatican and other Catholic churches in Rome itself.History is repeating itself as once again Islam is on the attack and Christianity sits by trying to pretend its not happening. Eventually Christians will strike back and defend themselves but by that time s of people will have been killed or had their lives shattered by Islam.
The most amazing thing here is that minutes tried to suppress this story and even when it was reported described what happened with watered down words. Try to imagine what minutes and the rest of our liberal self loathing press would done if a Muslim woman had been repeatedly sexual assaulted and beat by Christians while she was reporting on the jubilation during a Tea Party rally.
No one seemed to care or learned a lesson from Daniel Pearls story. Will anyone learn a lesson over Logans storyAs far as being held as a spy I dont get that this woman has been around for a long time now an internet search could very easily identify her as a journalist for CBS. So why the dog and pony show Hate Americans
I will give to anyone who can prove that that was a gang of Coptic Christians Episcopalians Quakers Amish Hindu or Wiccans.
The separation and assault lasted for roughly to minutes said a person familiar with the matter who added that it was not a rape. A CBS News spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement.
She should have known better than to go back. Pure stupidity. Even that dolt Ashleigh Banfield knew to darken her hair when she went to Afghanistan.
It would be impossible for them to know shes a Jew because according to the NY Post Logan is not Jewish. Because Muslims believe Jews to be apes and pigs and deserving of nothing better than torture and death accusing her of being Jewish justified gangraping her.Calling one a Jew is an accusation to the Muslim mindset only. Being Jewish or mistaken for a Jew is of course not an accusation to the rest of us who know that being Jewish is not a crime.
is there a script for Muslim men gang raping an unbelieving woman in Katie Korics Muslim sitcom
Most of the Egyptian soldiers are Christian. Muslims dont follow orders to well nor have any patience or tolerance. Having a genetic disorder of dementia is not good for being in the ArmyI would bet the farm that the attackers were muslim They dont respect women and she was a foreign Infidel alsoI would hazard a guess that you would rather believe the attackers came in from outer space for some fun with the female earthling.something similar to ShoreLeave right
FYI.its not a religion cupcake Its a political ideology wrapped up in a pseudoreligious context They all read the Koran and must follow what their false prophet Mobaby PBUH said that the Angel Gabriel Herald of God told him. MoBaby PBUH had obviously been smoking too much goat turd in his hookahAntisemitism is at the heart of this Satanic following of cretins. Better do some heavy reading about the so called Religion of Peace there Lindsey. Perhaps youll actually be able to talk some sense the next time you decide to comment on this board
Oh I get it the barbarians who surrounded and raped her may not have been muslim but the soldiers who rescued her WERE muslims.hmmm makes PERFECT sense And of course muslims love Jews so it wouldnt be muslims shouting JEW JEW JEW while she was being raped must have been those minority bloody Coptic christians out rampaging again
How on earth can all these reports speak of security around Mrs. Logan and then recount the rape of mins. What kind of crapsecurity is that The Network has some serious questions to answer on that one.In the Netherlands still a country at peace we have presence of securityguards a bulletproof vest for our Member of Parliament Geert Wilders even when hes not in a crowd of a million civilians
After joking about the sexual assault of CBS chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan while she was reporting from Egypt New York University fellow Nir Rosen has resigned reports the National Review.Nir Rosen is always provocative but he crossed the line yesterday with his comments about Lara Logan wrote Karen J. Greenberg executive director at NYUs Center on Law and Security. I am deeply distressed by what he wrote about Ms. Logan and strongly denounce his comments. They were cruel and insensitive and completely unacceptable.Greenberg said Rosen misunderstood the severity of Logans attack and that hes filed his resignation.Mr. Rosen tells me that he misunderstood the severity of the attack on her in Cairo. He has apologized withdrawn his remarks and submitted his resignation as a fellow which I have accepted Greenberg wrote. However this in no way compensates for the harm his comments have inflicted. We are all horrified by what happened to Ms. Logan and our thoughts are with her during this difficult time.
So CBS tried to hide the incident. Imagine if it was a Tea Party Rally and just Christian raped her I hate the hypocrites in the Lamestream press. They are the true enemy of this country.
You have to remember Marxists or Liberals really believe that these scum are peaceful. It was probably a shock to her that these scum acted in a natural way to her like they do all people that dont follow the Mooslim religion. Our media are dominated by brainwashed Marxists who are pretty dang stupid.
war correspondent who is back home with her kids and recovering after being brutally attacked last week in Egypt has vowed to return to work within weeks.She is going to be OK a friend told TMZ.perfect. amazing woman. I am so glad her serious injury was not critical. I hope she continues with her Wael Ghonim interview and he again inspires the best of his fellow Egyptians.As for the educationally retarded and emotionally undisciplined people in Egypt or the worldwell its gonna be quite a job to bring them up to speed.Isolated uneducated fools are found in Arizona Grocery store parking lots as well as in Egyptian crowds. Every country has its fundamentalists and hotheads and rapists and murderers.like home schooled hillbillies sometimes mom and pops just dont have all the answers the rest of the world has discovered in the last years.Fundamentalists like teens or wild kindergartners with guns must be be approached carefully lest they be spooked. but if disarmed and secured they can easily be wowed by simple wisdom and fancy cigarette lighters. I think intense classical music and cheese raviolis work too.Surely American Christian Fundamentalism isnt the answernot intellectually or sexually. its another version of the problem.A brilliant education and healthy fun social opportunities including sexare the way towards civilization. You have to deal with sex if you want be healthy and real yourself let alone have credibility or make real progress with clueless horny extremistsor teens same thing.will know no more and live no better than was done years ago before Egypt ever existed.
Sloppy s by all those filthy uncircumcised jihad penises bleigh sorry that was gross but really what will it take for these idiots to realize these are NOT freedom patriots they are generation inbred psychotic child abusedraped zombie animals
Here is just another sordid example of the use of rape by Islam against women and children under Islamic doctrine. I cut and pasted it only to graphically expose the truth behind the Islamic propaganda that Islam is a religion of peace. The prophet Muhammads modus operandi was for him and his male followers to use rape against selected women and children as a means of terrorizing controlling dominating and subjugating. By raping the women and children in front of the subdued male husbands fathers and relatives Muslim men are also instilling in these men a sense of helplessness trauma and impotence in the face of Islam.My name is Vivian and I am years old. I have a little sister and brother. As a family we live in what is supposed to be a secure apartment.At . am May th a huge crowd had gathered around our apartment. They screamed Lets butcher the Chinese Lets eat pigs Lets have a party We live of the th floor and we got a call from a family on the rd floor saying that the crowd had reached the nd floor. They even chased some occupants upstairs. We were all very frightened. In our fright we prayed and left everything in Gods hands.Afterward we left our room and went upstairs to the top floor as it was impossible to go downstairs and escape. We got to the th floor and stayed with some friends. Not long afterwards we were surprised because some of the crowd coming out of the elevators right before we entered the room. We hurried into the room and locked the door tightly. At that time we heard them knock at the other rooms loudly and there were some screams from women and girls. Our room was filled with fear.We realized that they would come to us. So we spread throughout the room hiding in the corners. We could hear girls of to years old screaming Mommy ..mommymommomit hurts That time I didnt know that these little girls were being raped. After about half an hour the noise diminished and we had some guts to go out and check. It was indescribable. A lot some of them young girls were lying on the floor. Oh my God what has happened Seeing all of this we screamed and my little sister Fenny screamed hysterically and hugged her father.Uncle Dodi kept trying to stop them by offering money. His efforts were fruitless. And in the end people raped Fenny. Before beginning with the raping they always said Allahu Akbar an Islamic phrase in Arabic meaning God is great. They were ferocious and brutal.Not long afterward around men came to the room and dragged me. I also saw them forcing and dragging my Aunt Vera. But at that time I passed out and everything went blank. I became conscious at around or PM. My head hurted and I realized I had no clothing on my body. I cried and realized my family was still there. My father was hugging my mother and little bother Doni. I also saw uncle Dodi lying on the floor and Aunt Vera was crying over his body. I felt so weak and fainted again.The next day I was in the Pluit hospital. My father and mother were beside me. With all the pains on my body I asked Mom why Fenny. Mom I felt a stinging pain as I said these words. My cheeks were swollen. My mother cried again and couldnt speak any words while my father holding back his tears managed to smile at me. After days in treatment my condition has improved. With a sad look my father told me then what had happened. After I fainted people raped me. At that time my father still couldnt see well after being hit with a piece of wood. They raped me repeatedly. Then my father said Vivian Fenny is goneI was confused and cried out Why Dad My father couldnt answer. He told me to rest and went out of the room. I cried over and over again feeling that my life had no meaning any more. A week ago after I was released from the hospital I was told everything that had happened.When Fenny was raped she kept on fighting and so she was repeatedly slapped by her rapists. The last time she fought Fenny spitted on one of them. Offended the man grabbed a knife and stabbed Fennys stomach over and over again. Finally she died with blood over her whole body.My father told me that uncle Dodi had the same fate watched by aunt Vera who was also raped. Godwhy should all of this happen Where are you God Are you still alive My aunt Vera now stays with her parents. She is in shock. Her face is blank and refuses to eat. Almost every hour my mother and I cry over all these happenings. I can never forget.
The Crusades were a response to the previous Muslim reign of terror. The horrors of Abu Gharaib were perpetrated by Saddam you tool. Underwear on a terrorists head doesnt count.Thousands of innocent people including Muslims who arent Muslim enough have been murdered since including Christians in Egypt just recently. Sexual assault by Mulsims is rampant in every corner of the world they inhabit. Check out Malmo Sweden if you want more details.
a phenomenon found only within the Islamic ideology whereby Muslims are unable to accept andor admit to the cold hard truth that Islamic doctrine and core teachings as found in the Koran Sira and Hadith are principles of hatred bigotry racism terrorism rape slavery domination and subjugation of all nonbelievers Kafirs. e.g. The Muslim invaders had soon raped most of the women and children of the native population however they could not admit it because they were all truthophobic about what they had done.
Hunted down like the apes and pigs they are wrapped in salty bacon and told their moon God Allah is nothing but a dream right before separating their heads from the rest of their disgusting carcasses.I never imagined that a worldwide religous war would be waged in the modern era. More and more infidels are awakening to this undeniable fact and not a moment too soon. I for one will not live under Dhimmi status.
Rape is something that upsets and sickens any normal compassionate person. However I fail to see the strategic advantage in the incitement of hatred towards people of a religion or political ideology. The mob mentality sprung up a few years back in New York during the St Patricks day parade. In full view of everyone this happened young woman attacked. We should be inciting the men of this planet to step in and stop these acts or better still to prevent them from happening in the first place. I walked out of the college I work at in Toronto and had cause to pull aside a student who was speaking about a female student in a very derogatory manner. I gave him a good bollocking but his attitude was really sad to be honest. He clearly lacked respect for woman and felt quite justified in his comments. In Iraq woman spat on and scratched at the captured special forces soldiers being paraded more likely out of being repressed by men and seizing a chance to let out that frustration. I dont really care what someones religious belief is as long as it respects basic human rights. Id fight tooth and nail to protect a woman any woman and I sincerely hope I speak for the majority of the men out there be you Muslim Christian or anything else.To you who seems intent on providing all the evidence that you have as to the historical aspects of the Islamic faiths it isnt going to do much more than generate more hatred. You may in fact find information that proves your point but its a hollow win if achieved. Have you ever argued with someone and won and then felt after that the victory felt pointless You cant expect someone who is of the faith that you vilified to sit there and say to themselves Hmmm he or she is right I should really think about switching religion Seriously for someone who is at least able to compose a coherent message you cant honestly believe that you are going to do more than simply fuel the hatred within those that believe as you do anyway The route of the problem here is men who get their kicks out of raping. Simple as that. When I was at school in the North East of England I saw the kids divided by two types those that stopped fighting when the kid dropped and those that continued to kick. The kid that continues usually had lots of issues and the pleasure derived from seeing someone suffer was usually nurtured by really poor parenting. Which in this case may be a parent extracting the wrong things from religious writings but essentially its a parent whos teaching hatred not compassion.To Laras boss you should be ashamed. I have a very strong willed friend whos a lawyer whod go Egypt without hesitation if her boss sanctioned it. It scares the life out of me. Some people love the chaos. By sending her or even opening up the option to go you paved the way for this to happen. How can you not think an attractive white woman with blond hair was not a potential target of this type of behavior Im sure they have already rationalized their actions but really Your greed and need for the story had you sending her in after being already detained you want your head examined I hope she recovers and shelves these trips for her family.
its always a few right lindsey Although most polls in the middle east show that the majority of arab and muslims in the middle east support stoning death for converts to other religions Sharia and Bin Laden rape execution of adulterers..but just a few rightOk..i want to live in that PC world with u..yes lets keep that multicultural cowardice going.
PC multiculturism was invented to suppress free speech and opposition to liberals and the left. It is a tool to suppress any opposition to their complete control of communications nationally and internationally.
ah yes the liberal has arrived. I bet you would say the same thing if this was a Christian..Im sure..No not men no not EUropeno your stories are absolute BS.No there are not huge groups of western nonmuslim men walking around looking to rape women.no nice try in lala land..you seem like a great job applicant for the MSM.
Islam will eventually be uprooted from this region as well from all of the earth. Damn every notion of Allah and every honor to the false prophet Mohammed. Egypt will suffer for its sins but will yet turn to the Lord in the light of Israel Zech Isaiah .
The NY Post is the only news outlet reporting that the Muslims raping her were shouting Jew Jew Jew. 
Excuse me for saying asking but you were obviously not home schooled were you Hate to burst your spit bubble .home schooled children are a lot smarter than public schooled children. The reason being is that they arent indoctrinated with all the multiculturalism and PCLiberal gobbledygook The home schooled children actually get an education and are taught to rely on their common sense alsoNot many muslims in Egypt or other muslim countries have been educated.They go to prayers times a daydoesnt leave much time for actual learning. They also dont have the same curriculum that others do. The Koran is the only text book of worth along with books on how to amputate feet and hands or the proper stoning techniques.
perhaps we should send gibblett to go talk niceynicey to the muslims in Egypt. Gibblett can tell them that it wasnt nice to rape poor Lara and that they should stop doing things like this cause its just making them look bad to the rest of the worldLiberals are so effin clueless Dont know how they walk and talk at the same time
I think the reason no one is reporting it is because they dont want to make the Muslims look worse than they already do and have people saying See they are against Jews
Those disgusting men are the ugliest people Ive ever seen. They are slimy and gross and dont deserve to remain on the planet. They probably never get any women other than rape. They hate us because women are beautiful. Disgusting. Throw em in the prisons but first remove their tiny inch penises
Christianity was an evil religion when it did that and worse pure evil hatred of women and anyone not down with Jesus. Yes there is still that element showing its head these days. Christianity is evil as Islam is in the same way insisting that their beliefs are the only true one way to live and die. There can be no inherent respect between peoples when that is ones fundamental basis of belief. My way or death or hell or whatever else people create for unbelievers.
Christianity is based on a central figure who loved his enemies by dying for them. His followers are called to respond by loving their enemies as well. Without Christ as a fundamental basis of belief there can be no inherent respect between peoples. For example you dont seem to follow Christ and also dont seem to respect other people who may be different from you.
Over of Egyptian woman have their genitals removed before the age of . An intact infidel woman is considered red meat to be abused and shamed at will.Ms. Logan seems to believe the narrative being pushed my the mainstream media. Democracy loving crowd ready to live in harmony with each other. While I wish her a full recovery I find it insane that she would enter into this crowd of disgusting animals.
Christians do not believe in stoning their women or killing their children because of some type of shame that they brought upon the family. Christians dont believe in killing other Christians because they decide to change faiths. Most Christians do not believe on insisting that their beliefs are the only true way to live and dieChristians do believe that all beings have free will to decide.though Christians are suppose to show and speak about their faith.I guess you have fun on April Fools day The day set aside for all athiests to celebrate BTW.you can always convert to the muslim faith if that suits your ideals better
Muhammad produced no miracles and when pressed he claimed that his miracle is the Quran. Yet a cursory look at the Quran reveals that this book is full of errors. Quran is replete with scientific heresies historic blunders mathematical mistakes logical absurdities grammatical errors and ethical fallacies. It is badly compiled and it contradicts itself. There is nothing intelligent in this book let alone miraculous. Muhammad challenged people to produce a Surah like it or find an error therein yet Muslims would kill anyone who dares to criticize it. In such a climate of hypocrisy and violence truth is the first casualty.We are apostates of Islam. We denounce Islam as a false doctrine of hate and terror. However we are not against Muslims who are our own kin and relatives. We do not advocate hate and violence. Muslims are the main victims of Islam. Our goal is to educate them and let them see the truth. We are against Islam and not the Muslims. We strive to bring the Muslims into the fold of humanity. Eradicate Islam so our people can be liberated so they can prosper and break away from the pillory of Islam. We would like to see Islamic countries dedicate more time to science and less time to Quran and Sharia. We would like to see them prosper and contribute to human civilization. We would like to see the draconian laws of Islam eliminated and people are treated humanely. We strive for freedom of beliefs for equality of gender and for oneness of humankind.Today the humanity is facing a great danger. Islamic fundamentalism is on the rise and the hatred is brewing in the minds of millions of Muslims. This hatred must be contained or there would be disastrous consequences. We believe that the education is the only answer. Muslim intellectuals must realize that Islam is a false doctrine and they must let the rest of Islamic world know the truth. Islam is a religion that thrives on the arrogant assumption that it is the most logical the most scientific and the most perfect religion. While the fact is that it is the stupidest doctrine the most backward and absurd belief. Once the truth about Islam becomes common knowledge it will be weakened and the Islamic fanaticism will lose its fangs. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being expended to combat Islamic terrorism yet no effort is made to contain the ideology behind this terrorism. It is our belief that Islamic terrorism will not be eliminated unless and until the ideology behind it is exposed and eradicated. This is what we intend to do.
of all Egyptians are Muslim with the remaining overwhelmingly Coptic Christian a sect which has a high percentage of devout practitioners. The Coptic Christians are decidedly NOT hostile towards Jews which makes it unlikely they would be hurling Jew Jew as an epithet while committing such a grievous mortal sin as rape. So while it is certainly possible Logans attackers were not Muslims its highly probable that they were indeed Muslims.Regardless it is neither fair nor right to condemn the many for the actions of the few. If those animals could be found and brought to justice by the Egyptian authorities it would send a powerful message.
Why bring circumcision into it In the middle east they consider uncircumcised female genitals filthy but I guess they thought Lara Logans were good enough
The truth that Islam is a cursedGod hated religion being a blatant affront to the declarative glory of I AM and a manifest conduit prepared for many ordained to eternal damnation is not contingent upon what happened or didnt happen to this woman. The history of Islam is a testimony against itself as is the Koran. It will burn in the fires of Hell along with its adherents

and hundreds of thousands of writings from human history we all have to chose from.
We feel very sorry for what happened to Lara and we are all offended by this act. when i say we i speak about Egyptians Muslims and Christians. i know for most of you you dont easily accept these words. but i dont blame you. i blame the biased media that has been playing this role for a long time. i lived in the states for years where i went to the university there. i witnessed the medias role against its view for the middle east. In Egypt ive a lot of christian friends friends from all over the world. Yes you can find a minority of bad muslims but that doesnt mean that all muslims or islam in principle is the devil. Again i repeat my deepest aplogies for that brutal act. but i say for these who bring up numbers and statistics about egyptians and would like to show to others how ignorant we might look like. its very easy to do the same thing whether youre an american or coming from any country. but you as a christian a jew should and should have been taught this in your religion is whomever doesnt have a sin in his life to throw her with a stone.
What about all those Christian Catholic priests sticking their filthy dicks in the bums of little boys That isnt rape They arent animals Arent these acts institutionalized Covered up by the Vatican Why is that different you Muslim hating bloggers How about the millions of Catholics who turn a blind eye to the vile doings of their spiritual leaders Religion is corrupt by naturea steaming pile of horseshit.
There were no police forces at all from till a week after mubarak stepped downOn the prisons were opened by the corrupt police loyal to the regime and prisoners were loose on the streets steeling killing and rapping.The state TV which was under control of the regime said that all foreigners and tv crews in tahrir square are spies.bec they didnt want anybody to show the world what was happeningNot to mention that there were paid promubarak thugs everywhere trying to cause chaos and blame it on the peaceful demonstrators.more than young egyptian protesters men and women were killed these people were out calling for a life with dignityrespectno corruption.etcI am sorry for what happened to Lara logan she is in my prayers but it was not the the peaceful demonstrators who did thatToo many people have died for the sake of the beliefs of the Egyptian revolution for u to insult it
In the middle east they think women in general are filthy the men are animals and should be treated accordingly. Middle eastern scum.
The amount of hatred and ignorance demonstrated in the above comments makes me realise how similar the mindset of people are across all religions when they dont see people as individulas. You are no different from that mob if you cant see the cycle of blame and predjudice stop has to stop. People of all religions have been victims and perpretrators of rape and abuse through out the ages. Rape and violence is a human action that takes a terrible toll on their human victims end of story. I wish Lara and all decent people of any religion nothing but good will.
